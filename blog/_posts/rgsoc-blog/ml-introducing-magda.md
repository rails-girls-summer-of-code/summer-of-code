Hi, I'm Magda. This is my coding story.

For me coding is freedom. Freedom from the corporate world, from being tied to one city, from an office, from a 9 to 5 lifestyle, and most importantly - freedom TO be creative. This is why I started coding - to be able to live the life I've dreamed about without resigning from my professional aspirations while expressing my creativity.

Rails Girls Summer of Code was the best thing that could happen on my way to ultimate nerdiness. I have chosen impress.js, one of the most starred open source projects on GitHub. Impress.js was created by my awesome, dedicated mentor, Bartek. It is a JavasScript framework for building presentations using an HTML5 canvas. That means a lot of JavaScript. As an aspiring front end developer it has been a perfect project for me.

For the last two months I had the opportunity to write some juicy JS code. I was developing new features for impress.js - plugins for automatically generated layouts, substeps and more. And then came the idea to create an application for end users to create presentations. I created a Rails application that generates the code for a presentation based on the user's choices. The prototype is already working, but my imagination for additonal features is endless. Luckily, I still have some time to make it more awesome.

If I could code anything in the world I would bootstrap my lucrative startup. This is not a dream, it's a plan :).

A big thanks to the people who rescued me from beginer frustration and helped me understand what is going on: Bartek, John, Chris, Mateusz - you saved my passion for coding. Thank you!
