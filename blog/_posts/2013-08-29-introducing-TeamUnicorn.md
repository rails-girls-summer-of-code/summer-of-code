Hi everyone!

<img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3309295/1042495/f67988da-0fec-11e3-89bb-b91059b19309.jpg" width="500">

We’re Hester and Victoria. We live in the Netherlands but Hester lives in Groningen (north) and Victoria lives in Eindhoven (south). We met by chance in June just few days before the application for Rails Girl Summer of Code was closing and also by chance we ended up doing this amazing Summer of Code together.

Victoria was still living at that time in Helsinki, at the same time moving to the Netherlands and it was great surprise to meet people even before arriving to the new country.

We didn’t get selected for the sponsored teams but still we wanted to make a team and we wanted to do something with Ruby on Rails during summer. We started on July 1st with a super intense session of more than 6h. Our brains were dead… and we continue from time to time. 

Find time to do this voluntarily after work is very hard. Victoria works at Startupbootcamp with Dutch Expansion Capital and Ernst & Young in Eindhoven. Hester is running her own business, Noordwijs, in Groningen. 

Why Team Unicorn? It is there something cuter than unicorns? That is why! 

We first heard about RGSoC through [@railsgirls](http://twitter.com/railsgirls) and Facebook. That is also how we found each other to start the project. Hester already had been in contact with [Peter](https://twitter.com/pberkenbosch), our super coach, who is helping us a lot!

Our project is [Spree](http://spreecommerce.com/) an open source e-commerce platform. Our coach was already working with them for a while and he introduced us to them. We decided to go for it and also Spree team were supporting us since the beginning.

Our goal for the summer is basically to improve our Ruby on Rails skills, give something to the Spree project, make Peter proud of us, and of course, have a lot of fun!

So far, we have been working in tutorials and recently started to do our baby steps in Spree. So far, very happy!

A few of our happiest moments so far are when things work after a few tries, when big problems become easy(or at least easier) and also seeing RGSoC brought us more than just programing skills.

If we could code anything in the world… Victoria will code an application to order breakfast delivered home on weekends, and Hester will code more one to make more time!
