Hello, we are Laura and Adriana, two college students from Colombia and we are the [New Rosies](http://newrosies.tumblr.com/). We met each other one year ago in a computer networks class at college.

**¿Why New Rosies?** We call us New Rosies in honor of the group of women programmers in World War II whose story is told in detail in the documentary "Top Secret Rosies" and like them we want to contribute in the field of computer sciences and programming.

We heard about RGSoC from Guillermo and Roberto, our current mentor and coach whom we thanks for giving us all the tools needed and the knowledge acquired in this summer and specially for working with us during this months while we were developing the project, **Conductor**. 

Conductor is a original project from **DHH** (creator of Rails), the idea behind the project is create an assistant for the Rails applications development. Conductor allows to do through its web interface many of the actions that we normally do in the command line and that are often very hard to remember for beginners.

This project has been a chance to improve our Ruby skills, to learn more about Ruby on Rails and how some of this internal parts work, also we learnt about other common tools used in Ruby community like Bundler, Rack and Sinatra. We learnt to take advantage of all the benefits of version control systems, about Git and the advantages that Github offers as a repository hosting. Finally and maybe more important than the other lessons, we learnt to have more interaction with the developer community and be part of an open source project.

One of the happiest moments until now, after receiving the news of being chosen within many students to participate in this summer program, was to know that we will go to StrangeLoop conference and we will have the opportunity not only to hear experts in different topics but also to talk about Rails Girls and Rails Girls Summer of Code.

**If you could code anything in the world, what would you work on?**
**Adriana** would create a program that would prove theorems. *-*



**Summer is almost over but we don’t want it to leave.**
