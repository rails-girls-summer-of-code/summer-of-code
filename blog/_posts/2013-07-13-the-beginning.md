Our journey has begun and we're right on track, code island starboard ahead!

Since July 1st we wrote 222 emails,<a href="https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/"> 133 blog posts </a> have been posted by the teams, they spent more than 99 hours of coding - and this is only the beginning!

It's been now 12 days since the summer of code officially started and here are the students of 12 teams saying hello world and obviously being super happy about their Summer of Code! Thanks to everybody who made this happen &hearts;
