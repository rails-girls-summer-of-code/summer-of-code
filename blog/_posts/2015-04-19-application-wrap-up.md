Our application period has officially ended a few days ago; some of us (I'm looking at you, Sara and Anika) stayed up past the deadline to answer all of your questions. The last 24 hours before a deadline tend to be wild, and we've witnessed a lot of last-minute applications coming in – but we made it!

We've received 61 applications from 19 different countries and all continents (okay, except for Antarctica). At the time of closing, there were still 46 application drafts(!!). It makes us so happy to see there is such a huge interest in our Rails Girls Summer of Code **worldwide**, and now it's time for the next step: we're looking forward to reading all of your applications.  

Here's a rundown of what's going to happen in the next few weeks:  

**April 16th — April 24th: Mentor Sign-off**  
The mentors will have a few days to "sign off" on your applications, to certify that you've contacted them about your project plan.  

**April 25th — May 10th: Selection**  
Our selection committee will go through all the applications several times and select the best ones. We are foreseeing some long days and nights, but we will hopefully get through it unharmed, just in time for...

**Mid-May: Acceptance letters!**  
By mid-May, we will hopefully have made a final decision on the selected teams, and each one will receive an email from us. \o/  

**Mid-May: Closing the crowdfunding campaign**  
As much as we <3 seeing just how many people are willing to support us in order to fund our students, by the time we will have sent the acceptance letters, it will also be time to close the [crowdfunding campaign](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/).  

THANK YOU again to all of you who applied – you will hear from us soon!
