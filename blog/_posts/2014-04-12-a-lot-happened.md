Hi there! We have made some changes to the website and we thought we would let you know!

First off: There is now a Support Chat for the community where you can hop on to give us all your questions - wether it's about applying, getting involved, sponsoring etc. See you in here: 
**[Rails Girls Summer of Code Campfire Chat](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.campfirenow.com/da52f)**.

We also added a **[Code of Conduct](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/code-of-conduct/)** for the project - which was admittedly much overdue. A primary goal of Rails Girls Summer of Code is to be inclusive to the all of our part-takers - participants, coaches, mentors, supervisors and everyone in the organizing team, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). Our Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community and introduces **our super-amazing Trust Committee** composed of both core organizers and externals.

We added **[Sponsorship Guidelines](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/sponsorship-guidelines/)** to outline what we are looking for sponsors. Spoiler alert: we are looking for companies that can identify with the values of Rails Girls Summer of Code and stand behind our mission to support women in technology and furthermore getting more women into Open Source. Do [check 'em out](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/sponsorship-guidelines/) if you're curious!

We also had **loads of mentions during local Rails Girls events and Ruby user group meetups**. [Laura Wadden](http://twitter.com/laurawadden) gave a lightning talk during a [Rails Girls Berlin ](http://railsgirlsberlin.de)workshop in  last week, and [Laura Gaetano](http://twitter.com/alicetragedy) did the same at [Rails Girls Ostrava](http://railsgirls.com/ostrava) in the Czech Republic. Miss Gaetano also mentioned our ambitious project during a recent [vienna.rb](http://vienna-rb.at/) meetup (the Ruby user group in Vienna, Austria), as I did at the Berlin chapter. Judging from our Twitter response there are a lot of Rails Girls and user group chapters that will also host a Rails Girls Summer of Code related (lightning) talk. And the beauty is: everyone can do it! Do reach out if you feel you need any extra information, feel free to shoot us an email and we will bring you up to speed: [summer-of-code@railsgirls.com](mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com).
