Heja hej,<br />
That would be awesome, but I’ve got to find some job for the holidays. Poor students, you get it ;) So maybe one evening in the week together? try to code or sth?</p>

That sounds great! But I’ve sth better :D Why don’t we take part in Rails Girls Summer of Code? I’ve heard about it at <a href="http://www.railsberry.com/">Railsberry</a> and the idea is more than coool :) We will work together on an open-source project :) Maybe even with <a href="https://twitter.com/agnessa480">Agnieszka Figiel</a>, who gave talk at Railsberry :) BTW, I met her a few days earlier while <a href="http://railsgirls.com/krakow2013">Rails Girls Kraków</a> - she coached as well as I did.

it’s in pairs, isn’t it? Wiktoria, you know that I love you, but you know as well that I’m not on THAT level on programming. Not for such a big project. And the thing is that I don’t want to spoil it, to crush your thing. I can help you if I know sth, but you should look for someone else. I’m not the best person for RGSoC.</p>

No, Alicja, no. You’re great and it is also said, that it’s for beginners, so the goal is to learn. We can do it!

//and here several mails W: We can do it! A: Noooo... My skills suck, no waaaay....<br />
// Finally...</i></p>

  ...and that was how the stoty begins :) We got the opportunity to work on the Species+ project. Its goal is to create a nice and readable visualization for endangered species in Poland , based on the UNEP-WCMC api.<br />

  Things we’ve learned so far:
  <ul>
    <li> error messages don’t bite.</li>
    <li> don’t panic! and ask your friends around you (don’t code alone!) </li>
    <li> read <a href="stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, because probability that someone has already had the same problem is huge.</li>
    <li> community rocks! People want to help you. Gratuitously. For love. Having no buisiness.</li>
    <li> if you want to do something, and you think “no, it’s not possible”, it means you simply didn’t dig through a documentation or Google uncle enough. </li>
  </ul>

  <strong> Making it short: RASP! (read, ask, StackOverflow, post) </strong>


  <div class="happy_moments">
    <h3> Happy moments: </h3>

    Wiktoria: I’ve had many happy moments so far. The first one - when we got accepted for being Rails Girls coaches in Poznań :) Then came hard times on parser, and when it finally put out what we wanted I was very happy! Wining tickets for dotRB conference made my week. And my little triumph - when I explained, like a pro, a Java programmer, what Ruby is and where can be used :)

    <br />
    <br />

    Alicja: First thought - <a href="http://www.dotrb.eu/">dotRB.eu</a>! Paris, I dreamt about it, really, trully! (imagine that: <i>Mom, Dad, I’m going to France for a programming conference!</i> - I felt 10 inch higher)
    But there is more. The moment when our really tiring JSON-parse finally worked. And... when we got messages from guys who are not our coaches or mentors, but they simply want to help us! I was touched, even if It sounds cliché.

  <div class="code_dream">
    <h3> If you could code anything in the world, what would you work on? </h3>

    Alicja: The question is: how to make life easier or happier? What takes me too much time everyday? I would like to create a pick-clothes app, which would choose the clothes from my wardrobe (photos and parametres wrote in by me) depending on the weather on a particular day.

    Wiktoria:
    I would solve the travelling salesman problem.
