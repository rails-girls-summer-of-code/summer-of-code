Because it’s weekend, we have a very special hug for you - a mix between a crocodile hug and a dragonball-power-spell. We figure, everybody can use one of these once in a while (especially while coding!;)

Soo, what’s been going on this week?

[The Conference call](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/conference/)! Did you pick your favorite ones yet? You have until monday 12:00 pm to tweet us your whislist (no, we are not Santa, but we’re trying really hard to ;) ) 

Team Hackety Hack is preparing [a screencast](http://teamhackety.wordpress.com/2013/07/26/july-26th-week-2-unanswered-questions-filter/), Team Species+ got visits from [McGuyver and Indiana Jones](http://dalach.blogspot.de/2013/07/when-indiana-meets-macgyver.html ),
Diasbits know more about [Jekyll](http://defendingdiaspora.wordpress.com/2013/07/25/jekyll/ ) than-you-do and New Rosies are offering you [a sneak peek](http://newrosies.tumblr.com/post/56494607526/creating-our-rack-framework) at their newly created Rack framework (which they’ll release on GitHub soon-ish).

Over in Berlin team Highway to Rails learned about the [difference between the internet and the web](http://highwaytorails.tumblr.com/post/56431303669/day-17-25-7-2013-more-action-mailer). And they received an email from their app ;)
Team Bundler in LA tries to [make their tests fail](http://rgsocbundler.github.io/2013/07/24/week2-day7.html) (really!) and
Magda learned about the [essence of refactoring](http://lipen.co/til/more-is-new-less.html).

Do you love this as much as we do? The video is proving once again that we have nothing to prove: Women can be geeks, too! Make sure to check it out! Maybe some of you want to submit your own crazy picture to http://geekgirlvideo.tumblr.com/ (and represent Rails Girls Summer of Code!).

... and this is only a selection of what has been going on this week. Check out more here: [teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org](teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org).

Have a geeky weekend, everyone!
