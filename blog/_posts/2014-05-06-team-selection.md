After 60 hours of rating over 100 applications for Rails Girls Summer of Code,
we now are proud to say: we've made the first step. We have selected the first
7 teams and will notify them throughout the day via email. 

Because this is the second edition of RGSoC and our future students had so much more time to prepare, this year's average of applications was even richer, more complex and an even higher 
standard than last year. So many amazing applications but also, so hard to pick only very few of them.

We still have 3 spots for teams left, which could be accepted, provided that we
are still able to fund the budget.

We are currently at USD 74 K, that means we need only USD 16 K to fund
those last seats. Please help us take on 3 more wonderful teams, and make
their dream of a Summer of Code come true. 

Let's [help fund them](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) and start
another summer with 10 awesome teams!
