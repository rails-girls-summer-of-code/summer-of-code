Did you hear? [The nerdies are here!](http://bit.ly/1793rWX)


The truly amazing girls of Unerdwear released a **limited edition of a Rails Girls Nerdies**. AND they donate all the profits to RGSoC to make your summer even better! True Story. The Nerdies will probably sell out in a minute, so be quick as a cat!


We hear rumors that, while wearing them, your code will get magically better ;) <br>
So [get your hands on them now](http://bit.ly/1793rWX)!
