So much love! 

Travis launched their [Foundation](foundation.travis-ci.org) officially last friday and the happy happy news made quite some noise in everybody's tiwtter feed/ mail boxes. Great news for Open Source, since they launched Open Source Grants and will basically support amazing things happening. &hearts;
