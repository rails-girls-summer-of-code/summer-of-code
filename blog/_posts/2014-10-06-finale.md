It's real. We can't believe it, it's been such a wonderful journey. These were the last days of the Summer of Code!

The program came to an official end as of the 30th of September, so we took a few days to think about the things we enjoyed most about this year’s proceedings. We asked the people behind RGSoC to take some selfies to share their favorite moment/lesson/thing of their summer or a message for you.

### If not me, then who

As awesome as it sounds, RGSoC is not just willed into existence by the magical powers that be. It's achieved through the hard work and dedication of organisers, supervisors, coaches, mentors and helpdeskers. It's achieved through the incredible financial support of sponsors and the wider community and last, but not least, the [Travis Foundation](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/).

So, scratch that. There **was** a whole lot of magic happening. Everyone involved spread their unique mix of fairy dust on whatever they took on, from blog posts, to tweeting, to finding sponsors, and gathering conference tickets, to answering queries on the helpdesk in the middle of the night.

It’s this spirit of working together as a community that reminds us why we make RGSoC happen. All of you are the magical spark who made this fairy tale come true again.

Emma Watson made a very eloquent and timely observation in her speech for the launch of the ally-campaign, #HeforShe, a few weeks ago; “If not me, then who? If not now, then when?”

To everyone who said *"It's going to be me."* - to supporting RGSoC, to supporting more women and more diversity in Open Source - you deserve no less than a standing ovation. You are our heroes and heroines, and have made it clear the sort of place you want the Open Source community to be.

### 32 new beginnings

With the help of the wonderful community we raised $95 k, and with that money we were able to provide sponsorship to 10 teams - that's 20 participants. We also had 6 amazing volunteer teams this year, wich brings us to 32 students in total.  [32 stories to tell](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/), 32 new beginnings.

The teams worked on projects such as Rubinius, Spree, Bundler, Diaspora*, BrowserSpree CMS, Speakerinnen, Species+, created a tool for documentation testing or started a migraine tracker - to only name a few. Meet the teams here: [https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams).


### Something to remember the summer

To fight any post-summer-of-code-blues, we began to creating a mixtape dedicated to this year's RGSoC, and we want your song to be on it! Which song made your summer? Just [tweet to us](https://twitter.com/railsgirlssoc) with the link to the song on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) and we will make it a part of the mixtape.

This is something to remember us and your summer of code by. To listen to and rock your post-RGSoC-blues away. Enjoy!

Because these last days are not the end, they are the beginning of 32 new stories.
