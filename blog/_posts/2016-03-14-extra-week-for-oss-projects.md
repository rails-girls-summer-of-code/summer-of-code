![Extra Week of OSS project submissions](/img/blog/2016/extra-week-for-oss-projects.gif)


Good news for all project maintainers: We are re-opening up our project submissions for one extra special week. This gives you more time to submit your Open Source project still for RGSoC 2016!

As you may have noticed, we have closed our project submissions in February. Since then, we have been receiving messages from people who really wanted to submit their projects as well, but for many reasons, they missed the deadline. After a careful reflection, we decided to give everyone an extra week to submit their OSS projects.

So, mark down in your calendar:

#### The extra week of project submission starts today, 14th March, and ends Sunday, 20th March at 17:59:59 UTC.

These [Open Source Projects](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects) are the basis of our program. From this list, the applicants choose projects they want to work on during the summer and apply for those. The selected teams will then work full-time on them for three months with the help of coaches and the project maintainers. This will allow the students to grow as developers and, at the same time, bring more developers into Open Source Software.

In order to submit your Open Source projects, find out what makes a good project, what programming languages we accept (spoiler: all of them!) and how much time you need to be a mentor - please read our [Guide](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/).
