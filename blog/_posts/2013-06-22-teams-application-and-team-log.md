Our little [Rails Girls Summer of Code Teams application](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams)
is getting closer to actually being useful.

This application is meant as a central place to aggregate activity at
Rails Girls Summer of Code, and it now can be used to register your team (we've
already added all sponsored teams), add team members and profile information.

Here's how to use it:

#### Your own account

Signing in through GitHub will create a user account on our side. If your account
has already been added by one of your team mates then you'll claim your account
by signing in through GitHub.

Once signed in you can update your profile information. Please tell the
community a little bit about you, maybe tell why you're participating, what you
hope to get out of this, etc.

#### Your team's profile

On the [teams list](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams) check if
your team has already been added. If you're already part of this team then you
can update your team's profile.

If you haven't been added to your team, yet, then ask one of the members to
sign in and add you. They will need your GitHub handle for that (the GitHub
handle is your user/login name, the one that appears in the URL when you go to
your GitHub account).

Please work with your team to make sure that your team's profile tells the
community about your project plan, how and where you plan to work, ... everything
that might be useful or fun to know :)

If your team has a GitHub organization (you might want one and they're free
for Open Source) then please add the handle. If your team has a Twitter
account, then please add it, too.

#### Your team's sources

Your team can register "sources" from which this application will try to
aggregate updates.

Please add your team log and any other blog that is relevant for your team,
by registering its RSS or Atom feed URLs. Read more about the
[team log here ...](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/team-log)

Please also add all the GitHub repository URLs that you are planning to
work on as sources.  Currently this won't actually do anything, yet, but we
plan to aggregate information from there, too.

#### Just ask!
