We love coding, we **really** do. But we also know that during a 3-month-long, hands-on coding program (or *cough cough* at work if you’re coding all day *cough cough*) your motivation might start to take a nosedive. This is why we are announcing a

### *“Rails Girls Summer of Code Day Off” on **August 28th**!*

<div align="center"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1711357/4011384/b55fe45c-2a03-11e4-9459-a4ef28d8b130.gif"></div>

What that means: exit your terminal, close your laptop and do something awesome or relaxing with your team mate! Some of us are in Berlin, and there will be a small get together for local teams (yes, an afternoon on a houseboat - wonderfully sponsored and organized by [Applift](http://www.applift.com/?gclid=CNuxwer_psACFYrpwgodBD8A0Q)); but since RGSoC is a worldwide movement, we won’t let distance stop you from having a great time. We just want you (yes, YOU dearest students; but also coaches, mentors, supervisors..!) to have a fun day, wherever you may be!

### *Our favorite 10 ways to spend your day off*

We have gathered a list of the best 10 ways to take a day off, feel free to try out some or all or to think up your own. And of course: you’re welcome to DOCUMENT ALL THE THINGS - e.g. sending us funny pictures of you relaxing with your favorite pet or going out for a hike. We love all your tweets.

### 1. Explore your hometown in an alternative way
The [Laboratory of Experimental Tourism](http://www.latourex.org) has a few fun ways to explore places - even in your own hometown. Some of our favorite examples:  
- Counter travel (Travel with a camera, but don't take pictures of the famous landmarks and tourist attractions. Stand with your back to the sight and snap that view instead.)  
- Alternating Travel (Leave your home on foot. Take the first road on the right, then the next on the left, then the next on the right, then the next on the left, etc. Carry on until something, a no man's land, a building or a stretch of water, blocks your path and you can go no farther.)
  
### 2. Organise a picnic
Food, music, blankets, and sunshine. Is there anything more lovely than that (especially the food part)? Find a park nearby, take some homemade sandwiches and cookies, bring a frisbee if you want, and relax! For the ultimate awesome experience, bring a scrabble with you (sorry, but I had to include that in there, as it’s my favourite board-game)
  
### 3. Movie marathon
Who said that movie marathons can only be done at night? You’re totally allowed to watch movies all day. Maybe you can each bring your all-time favourite movie - what a great way to get to know your team mate better! For the ultimate experience, we recommend making popcorn and choosing trilogies ;) Our favourite: Back to the Future, obviously! 
  
### 4. Yoga class
Or any other physical activity, whether to let out all of that energy or to relax. Was there something you always wanted to try but never dared to? Is there a boxing or self-defence class in a studio nearby? Did you always wonder about this strange “pilates” that everyone keeps talking about? Now is the time to try it out. Do you love playing volleyball or basketball outdoors? Go for it! And you know what they say: the more, the merrier - so bring your team mate along!
  
### 5. Go swimming
It’s summer! At least for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere ;) Need we say more? Maybe you’re lucky enough to live in a place with a lake or the ocean nearby. Run away from the city and go swimming!
  
### 6. Crafts
This could really be anything - from making your own laptop case to designing some cute birthday cards from all your friends or baking some (non-rgsoc-themed) cupcakes. 

### 7. Read
Grab a book or go into a newsagents' shop, buy ALL your favorite magazines and spend the day reading somewhere outside or snuggled up on the couch. It works wonders!
  
### 8. Have a “games” day
We’ve mentioned Scrabble already, but there is a ton of other games that you could play, and you probably have a few stacked away somewhere in a box, don’t you? Whether Uno, Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, Snakes & Ladders.. We’re sure you’ll be having the time of your life!

### 9. Have a media-free day
Leave your laptop and phone at home, and just head out. After the first few minutes (or hours..) you'll get used to it. You'll see, being phoneless for a few hours really isn't that hard (or bad) at all! 
  
### 10. Go wild at an amusement park
..because roller-coasters and bumper cars are definitely not just for kids.

<blockquote>Studies show that just "hanging around" and doing nothing and just lying on the couch all day won't let you feel very relaxed. Your brain wants to do things and experience stuff.</blockquote>

So make the best out of it, and **enjoy your RGSOC-DAY-OFF**!

*P.S. If we find any commits or signs of you working on this particular Thursday, we won't send you cat gifs in the following weeks! So. There. We are serious about this.*
