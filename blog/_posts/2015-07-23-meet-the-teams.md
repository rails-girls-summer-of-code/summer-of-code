Since July 1st our teams already wrote 320 [log entries](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/), spent more than 128 hours coding and are contributing to Open Source projects like Speakerinnen, Lotus, Ruby, Discourse, CocoaPods, Exercism [and many more](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams) - and this is only the beginning of the summer!

It’s been now 22 days since Rails Girls Summer of Code officially started and here are the students of 20 teams saying “hello world” from across the globe. Say hello to our teams from Melbourne, Sofia, Coimbra, Seattle, Berlin, Nairobi.. to name only a few.

Thanks to everybody who made this happen; to all our sponsors, private donors, and [everyone](/about/team) who is helping to build this program; to coaches, mentors, coaching companies, supervisors, organizers, designers, helpdesk coaches and friends. All in all, we are now over 140 people contributing to the program and we couldn't be happier to have so many helping hands. Welcome the RGSoC teams of 2015 who are changing the world of Open Source day after day: Greet them, read their [daily logs](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) and follow their Twitter streams, which you can find via our [public twitter list](https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC/lists/rgsoc-2015-teams).

Here is to a wonderful Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015!
