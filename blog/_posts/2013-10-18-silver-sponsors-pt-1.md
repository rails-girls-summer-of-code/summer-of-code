In the lead up to the Rails Girls Summer of Code, female coders around the globe were frantically refreshing the RGSoC donate page. Everyone was talking about what an amazing opportunity this summer was, how it would change so many lives, and how it had the potential to jump start the careers of women who had discovered their love of programming a little later on in life. 

With each passing day, the amounts donated grew bit by bit, and uncontrollable excitement followed. Tweets from potential students, all in caps locks, circulated, as companies thrilled by the idea of having more women in the vastly male dominated tech scene gave what they could. 

Without these constant and impressive donations, RGSoC wouldn’t be what is today, and for this, we have ten silver sponsors to thank. Here is the first half.

<a href="http://www.anynines.com/"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1333477/950bf636-3595-11e3-8803-d0fd71c5d826.png" width="200"></a>
**“Anynines is an upcoming PaaS written in Ruby. A hosting that grows with your apps!”** But Anynines isn’t just about business. the company also **“supports selected non-profit open source and charity projects with free hosting.”** Non-profit open source and charity projects? The summer of code couldn’t have found a better match. 


<a href="http://www.aupair-world.net/"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1333502/1182cce4-3596-11e3-9902-ebc342387544.png" width="200"></a>
**“Aupair World is the world’s leading au pair agency on the Internet. It lets au pairs and host families make contact with each other and arrange au pair placements directly and independently.”** With 24 full-time employees, Aupair World not only helps families find their perfect au pair, but is now also a supporter of RGSoC and female programmers around the world. Thank you!


<a href="http://de.dawanda.com/"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1333509/472d8ff0-3596-11e3-811d-91946941722a.png" width="200"></a>
Rails Girls in Berlin are already well aware of DaWanda. The company has supported numerous Rails Girls workshops, and many happy new programmers have walked away with DaWanda swag following a full day of coding, as well as a newfound love for the company. For those who don’t know, **“DaWanda is a marketplace where you can buy unique, customized and handmade products made by talented people, and sell your own creations.”** Thanks for the continued support DaWanda!


<a href="https://www.engineyard.com/"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1333520/73551c1a-3596-11e3-8714-58255bb4d3ba.png" width="200"></a>
**“Engine Yard is the leading Platform as a Service (PaaS) empowering developers to plan, build, deploy and manage applications in the cloud. Engine Yard was started in early 2006 to meet a genuine need: customers were developing business-critical Rails applications, but they didn’t want to worry about application deployment, management and scaling.”** Engine Yard is also committed to community, participating in meetups, user groups, conferences, and parties. As a community for women and and their supporters, we’re thrilled to have Engine Yard on board and a sponsor!

Next week, you’ll read about the remaining silver sponsors and their motivation to support RGSoC. Rock on!
