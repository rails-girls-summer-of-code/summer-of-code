The countdown to Rails Girls Summer of Code is over! Can you believe it!? July 1st is finally here! For the next 3 months, 40 women from 11 countries will be dedicating their summer â€” or winter, depending on the hemisphere they live in, â€” to work on Open Source projects and take their software development skills to another level. This summer is going to be one of the best summers of their lives and you know what? You made this happen!

#### <span class="color-red">The mystery unfolds...</span>
As you might recall, a couple of months ago, [we created our thank_you board](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-04-22-thank-you-lets-diversify-tech) and gave each individual donor a square with their name. We applied the same principle to each sponsor and attributed them a group of cards depending on the sponsorship package. We hope you liked this tiny and heartfelt gesture. <3 As time went by, the board transformed â€” or shall we say became more diverse â€” and along the way you might have wondered why we never added a square to the top three rows...

Until now! Those red squares were saved for our RGSoC 2016 teams: students, coaches, mentors and supervisors. More than anyone else, these teams will be dedicating their time and energy to this project, sharing their knowledge and giving back to the community. So, now that we are onboarding all the teams we can finally add them to our board! Whohoo!

#### <span class="color-red">Itâ€™s time to close our fundraising campaign</span>
As the Summer of Code begins, the fundraising campaign for RGSoC 2016 ends. And just like we did on previous years, we are now opening the fundraising campaign for 2017. This means that if you want to contribute to our program, [you can still do it](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/), but all the money we receive from now on will be used on the RGSoC 2017â€™s edition.

#### <span class="color-red">The 1st day of RGSoC 2016 all over the world</span>

The best part of our day 1 of Summer of Code is that it lasts more than 24 hours! Our first team to kick-off is from Melbourne (Australia) and the last ones are from San Francisco and Portland (USA). This is a 17 hour timezone difference and so far we were able to count 11 timezones! This makes RGSoC a 24-hour-non-stop-coding fun! So here they are, this year's 20 teams, in case you missed our previous posts. Oh, and if you want to follow them on twitter we made [this twitter list](https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC/lists/rgsoc-2016-teams).
