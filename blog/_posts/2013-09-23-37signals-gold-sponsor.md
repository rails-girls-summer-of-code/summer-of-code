[37signals](http://37signals.com) creates and maintains web-based applications for collaboration, project management, and information sharing. In their own words, they build ‘frustration-free web-based apps for collaboration, sharing information, and making decisions.’ They proudly work backed by their customers and buyers and without any external funding.

But beyond developing applications to help us get things done, they maintain a popular [company blog](http://37signals.com/svn) and job board, write insightful books, and their developers contribute regularly to various [open source projects](http://37signals.com/opensource).

## Productivity on Rails

In 2004, 37 Signals launched [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com), a web based project management app. Since then they have focused on building productivity applications, like [Highrise](http://highrisehq.com/), a CRM app; or [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/), a business oriented online chat service. These apps are used by millions of freelancers and smaller and bigger businesses around the world (including myself!). Their apps are the white T-Shirt of web apps: uncomplicated, neat and clean and always a fit.

In 2004, they made public [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), an open-source framework that was created by David Heinemeier Hansson for the Basecamp project that they had been using internally for a while. Without this Random Act of Kindness we wouldn’t be here today. The maintenance of Rails is now in the hands of the Rails Core Team with the assistance of the rest of the Rails Community.

## Sharing is caring

37 Signals sponsor Ruby on Rails and other projects, like our [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/), and play their part in fixing the job crisis by helping programmers and other smart people to [find a job.](http://jobs.37signals.com/)

In their free time (I’ve never been good at maths but something doesn’t seem right) Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson also wrote two books: [REWORK](http://37signals.com/rework), a must read if you’re thinking of getting into business or already working on a project; and [Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/), a great (and free) handbook for building web apps that shows the full picture and is written in plain English.

If you plan to spend a while in the world of technology, these are some good guys to learn from and look up to. Join us in sending them a lot of mental thumbs up!
