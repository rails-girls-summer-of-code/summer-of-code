##Google Open Source

Recognizing the vital role that open source software plays at Google, the Open Source Programs Office heavily supports the open source software development community. [Google Open Source](https://developers.google.com/open-source/) do this by releasing code created at Google, providing infrastructure, supporting open source organizations, handling internal open source compliance, and by running student outreach programs such as Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in.

Google Open Source send us these goodies, for the Rails Girls Summer of Code participants (soon, in a mailbox near to you!).

[Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/) is a global program that offers student developers to write code for various open source software projects. Since its first edition in 2005, the Google Summer of Code program has brought together over 6,000 successful student participants and over 3,000 mentors from over 100 countries worldwide, all for the love of code. Through Google Summer of Code, participants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, gaining experience with real-world software development scenarios, just like we aim to do with Rails Girls Summer of Code. 

Thanks for supporting us, Google Open Source, we love you back!
