##Conferencing

This week could have been called *the week of ultimate conference raffling*. As you probably know already, we got some tickets from awesome confs and this week the raffle fairy [picked some winners](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/the-big-conferenc-raffle-winners/)! Wohoo! This means no less than that beginning with eurucamp next week, our students will start to rock the tech confs of this world! &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;


##Hammertime, terminal tools and congratulations

Okay, let's have a log ;) at our Teams:

##RubyRubyRubyRuby!

Thanks to RGSoC mentor [Andy](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/users/115), everybody spent some minutes, hours, days addicted on this:
