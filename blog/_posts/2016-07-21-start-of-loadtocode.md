So at its core the LoadToCode team consists of two components: Thea & Marie. They found each other in Berlin on the way to learn programming. What a lucky coincidence! Now they are one of 20 teams all over the world that are participating in this year's Rails Girls Summer of Code. Of course, Thea & Marie are not the only components that are needed to make this summer as code- & joyful as possible...

**Say Hello to Berliner Team LoadToCode**

So our Rails Girls Summer of Code has started, we got welcomed by our hosting company SoundCloud and got an introduction to the company + a goodie bag! We get treated very well, coffee and food only adds to the good feeling!


## <span class="color-red">Here we are! LoadToCode = Thea + Marie</span>

Psssst: Here we are, sitting at our desks, looking very serious and trying to understand Rails, Git & LEAP. I mean, this picture is an exception, we normally don't look that funny.

## <span class="color-red">Hippie-Hackathon | What happened so far</span>
So we got invited to a whole week of a hackathon (we call it Hippie-Hackathon), full of LEAP-knowledge, Q&A with Leap-Coders & last but not least socializing via campfires and advanced mime guessing. *So how would YOU describe Quantum, SHA 512 or propietary software?*

This does not only look code- & joyful on the photos, it really was. A little campfire is highly recommendable for the teams who are having a winter of code or the teams that live in Germany!

## <span class="color-red">What we learned</span>
* Overview of LEAP Architecture
* Web Applications with Rails
* Git & Github

## <span class="color-red">What comes next:</span>

So in order to get more structure and keep track of our tasks, what we have done and we're we heading to, we created a Kanban board.

At the end of our 3rd week we're gonna improve our presentational skills and give an overview of the LEAP project to our coaches at SoundCloud. 20 minutes of presentation and 10 minutes Q&A, so we hope to be prepared enough for the tricky questions.

At the end some dog content! \o/ Here you see our favourite Colleague, adorable mate and patient listener!
