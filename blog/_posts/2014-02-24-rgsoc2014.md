Good news on a Monday and we want you to know it first:

**There will be a Rails Girls Summer of Code 2014!** Yay!

Do you want to join our team as an organizer? Wonderful! We are happy about every hand that helps with copy writing or fundraising, getting the word out, improving our apps, improve communication, the campaign or help our applicants find Open Source projects.

Shoot an email to [summer-of-code@railsgirls.com](mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com) and let's get the magic started!

We are currently working on the application process and will publish a guide amd more infos soon, so stay tuned!

P.S. Remember last year? Here is one of our favorite videos from Team Species+ who made a short film about their Summer of Code. Enjoy!

This really calls for another summer like it, doesn't it?
