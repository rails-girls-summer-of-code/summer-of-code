This year we got **190 applications**, which is twice more than last year (can you imagine our surprised faces?!). The applications came from **21 different countries**, some of them new to RGSoC: Albania, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka.

With happiness came lots of work selecting the teams who would be [best fitting](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/application/#selection) for the program. **19 people** with different backgrounds rated the applications for almost **two months**; it was a real challenge, as there were many really good applications. Two countries did especially great job this year: four teams from **Germany** and four teams from **India** made it to our TOP-10! Well done!  
Besides that, we were really happy to see that some students who applied last year have submitted applications again and been selected!

Selecting the teams means also selecting the projects which will participate in the Summer of Code. We are very proud to say that this year we have a very diverse technology stack! Time to think about a RGSoC rebranding! :D

The saddest part of the selection process is saying ‘no’ to some of the teams. As much as we want more diversity in tech, [our budget](/campaign/) is not big enough to fund all the teams that apply to RGSoC. We want to encourage all students who haven’t been selected this year to continue their path in programming and Open Source. While RGSoC is a great opportunity to learn and contribute, there are other ways to do it. One of them would be to contribute to the project you chose when applied to RGSoC (or [any other project submitted to RGSoC 2017](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/)); most mentors would be happy to help you make your first steps in Open Source. That said, please be assured that you are very welcome to [apply to RGSoC 2018](/students/application/).

But let’s not make you wait any longer. Here are the **20 teams of RGSoC 2017**.
