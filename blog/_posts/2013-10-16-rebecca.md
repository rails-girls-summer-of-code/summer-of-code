They are everywhere. Just glance to the right, at the bottom or click on any other page: The wonderful, cute drawings that made my day for the last four months.

Today we want to show you, who's behind that. Who made RGSoC look so amazing and could draw anything that we wished for. We are so happy she's here, please meet: Rebecca Conrad!

Some weeks ago we met at the Travis CI office and - some days now it's hard to believe - it was really warm outside. We chatted and I asked her some questions to get to know the woman whith the most amazing tatoos and the one who can draw like I always dreamed of. After doing a lot of funny friday-hug-pics, we settled down on the couch and started talking. 

###*How do you do these scribbles for RGSoC? At the computer?*

I actually start by plain drawing old fashion in my sketch books. Then i scan it and work on it at the computer, yes.

###*So, when did you actually start drawing?*

When I was a kid and I went with my class to the "Deutsches Technikmuseum", we had to draw the machines we saw there. I was the only one who had fun doing that - that's when I first realized, that I had a passion for drawing. 

But actually my whole family is crative: My grandpa is an author, my mom does poster design and draws, so no surprises there ;)

Later I went to a private graphic design schook and there I learned everything from comic to aquarell. This was really great, so with that I had a really good understandment of the different drawing techniques.

###*Did you always draw for yourself or did you share it?*

Well I always drew for myself in my free time, and after I did that 5-6 years regularly, I started my web page.

###*Which kind of has a weird name, right?*

Yeah (laughs) but it actually came because I wanted something with escape, so that explains the esc at the end. And then ejaculesc was born because I wanted something that referres to the creativeness. I wanted to show my "Künsterliche Ergüsse", and i merged it with the escape-thought so this is how I came to the name for my website.
Which is weird, I guess, but I like weird.

###*What do you like to draw best?*

I always draw and do scribbles. When I'm on the telephone with someone, my hands can't be still. I can't let any sheet of paper stay white. I'm like these people who always have to cook something or watch - just for me it's drawing. I like those abstract phone call sketches a lot. But my favorite are [these animals](), I draw lately. 

I also like crafting things, things you do with your hands: Pyrography, pottery and old fashion techniques like lino cut. I like to experiment a lot and always have phases I go through, so my favorites always change.

###*Sounds really fun! You also experiment with programming, right? You are part of the ruby monsters study group, that meets every monday in the Travis CI office. How did that start?*

In one of my former jobs, I sat in a room with two porgrammers, and I got more and more curious what mysterious number thing they were talking about so I went to find out. I attended a JS course from Open Tech School and was intreagued. I wanted to start solving this mysterious world of code.
Then I read about Rails Girls Berlin at Spoon and from there on everything took it's way.

Now I'm meeting up to program every week, but you can't leave it at that. You have to do that at home too and learn regularly. It's only working when you do it regularly and give it a lot of time. 

###*Did you have any goals when learning programming?*

At first I did it because it was fun, to do something that had nothing to do with drawing. Something people wouldn't expect from me. But on the other hand - programming is also creative and meditative, so it's actually not THAT far away.

Actually, I some day really would like to be able to create everything - like my whole website for example. I also have this idea about a small app, I want to build.

###*What kind of app?*

Just a tiny thing, some sort of trend indicator for your feelings. You would be able to push three buttons to indicate how you are feeling.

###*Are you going to continue coding?*

Yes! I want to start with building something small, and then get better with time. In the future everything will be more and more about the web and design also takes that turn. You need to know about programming in a lot of jobs already, Java, HTML, CSS. There's a lot to learn!
