Wow, it's been only one week since we [kicked off our crowd funding campaign](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) and we already have so much to tell! 

The historical moment was April 3rd, 12:01 CET, when we tweeted about it for the first time:

First, thank you all for being amazing supporters of our mission and making our dream of more women in Open Source come true more day by day! This is really moving. And while others can't stop high fiving about this, running around with a big smile in their faces or buying chocolate for everyone, some couldn't stand still anymore.

##WE JUST CAN'T HIDE IT

The whole team has bee so happy about this campaign! We [just can't hide it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS6eUIpwwds). Two of our organizers, Floor and Anika, even jumped around out of joy:

And these 7 days truly have been something to jump around about for all of us.

+ We funded 8 students in 7 days, 

+ got 110 retweets of our announcement tweets, 

+ had 2.233 website visits,  

+ have 64 individual donors, (we found two Tobias', two Patrick's, two Jeremy's in there),

+ got 17 &hearts;s in the comments

+ and have already 11 company sponsors hopping on board!


We are so happy about [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.com) joining as a lead organizing supporter through [Travis Foundation](http://foundation.travis-ci.org)and [Github](http://github.com) as a returning Platinum sponsor, supporting us from the very beginning. We also are super happy to announce [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) again as one of our biggest sponsors, as well as [Google Open Source](https://developers.google.com/open-source/). So great to see the magic happen again. 

##FAVORITE MOMENTS

Magic also always happens in the small moments and one of our favorite was definitely this donation comment from @eljojo:

Another week lays before us, we look forward to having even more amazing people and companies join our great supporters and help us bring our misson forward: Getting more women into Open Source!
