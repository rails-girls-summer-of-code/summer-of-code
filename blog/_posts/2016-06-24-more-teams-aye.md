Do you want more awesome news? Here we go!

We have managed to get **FOUR extra teams** on board this year!

Last week [we announced](/blog/2016-06-15-meet-our-teams) **seventeen** RGSoC 2016 teams. Unfortunately, one of them (TeamASU) has cancelled their participation for personal reasons. As much as we feel sorry when someone can’t do the Summer of Code after being selected, we are super happy to greet new teams. Now we have **twenty** in total! This is truly amazing, isn’t it? Remember, all of it became possible due to **your** support: the money [you sent us over the last few weeks](/blog/2016-06-10-RGSoC-campaign-wrap-up) opened up the possibility to sponsor 2 teams and support 2 volunteer teams. Thank you for making this happen!

And now, meet our new teams!
