At at recent organizers meeting we've decided to try and re-organize our work
in new teams.

Part of the reason is that Sven will have to step back from working on Rails
Girls Summer of Code a little bit starting July and start focussing on Travis
again. During the first weeks he will still be available about half-time and
Anika will continue to be available full-time, sponsored by Travis.

We'd like to ask everyone (who's not involved as a student, coach or mentor) to
join in and take over some responsibility :)

Ideally each of the following teams would have like 3-4 people so work can be
shared. Also, individual tasks (like write up a blog post about xyz, write a
certain email etc) obviously can be delegated, too.


### 1. Campaign and Sponsors management

We'll keep the campaign open until the end of the program, but we do not expect
many sponsors to sign up any more. Should some sponsor still hop on board I'll
be able to take care of adding the banner etc.

Sponsors need to be paid special attention to until after the program as much
as possible … eventually they're the ones who allow us to pay so many people!
We should make sure that we keep them in the loop about news regularly, write
up a sponsors blog post, … etc.

Tasks: come up with a concept and list of things that we can be done to make
sponsors happy (we've got a bunch of ideas), then implement these throughout
the program.

Who can take care of this?


### 2. Helpdesk and Team Supervision

Most of the time teams will be able take care of themselves since they've got
amazing local support networks anyway. But we should organize remote support
(answering questions on IRC etc) for when they get stuck and local coaches
aren't available.

This team makes sure coaches are available on the IRC channel #rgsoc-teams and
possibly connect people there. Also, team activity is being watched loosely
throughout the program (e.g. checking feeds on a daily basis or so), in order
to make sure everyone's work is humming away nicely.

Tasks: come up with a concept and list of things that can be done to ensure
teams have sufficient support and issues are being taken care of. Also:
encourage teams to connect to each other and have fun on the channels :)

Lucas and Robin are up to help with this, but are looking for a team lead
(Lucas will be on Eurucamp starting August, mostly). Who would like to join?


### 3. Blog, Newsletter and Press

This team writes up news in order to keep our community in the loop, and tell
the world about the program.

Keep in mind there needs to be at least one sponsors blog post, and teams are
supposed to write up posts, too.

Tasks: come up with a concept and list of things that need to be written and
published, then implement this.

Anika is great at doing this, and she'll have time, but she'd still love to be
supported by 1-2 authors who like to write. Who's up?


### 4. Website

This team takes care of the website and makes sure it stays up to date with the
progress of the project.

Lisa can take care of implementing things. Also, Anika and Robin might help
out. The team is still looking for someone with design skills and others who'd
like to help out. Is that you? :)


### 5. Teams App

The app should be mostly done before July, but might need updating once in a
while.

Sven can still take care of this for the time being, but it would be cool if
someone with solid Rails dev skills could take this over. Any takers?


If you'd like to help with any of these then please raise your hands by
posting to our [community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/groups/rails-girls-summer-of-code-community) :)
