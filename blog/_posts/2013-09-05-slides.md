A few days ago, we put together a conferece survival kit for you, dearest students.
Now you know almost everything there is to know and we are sure, you'll return from your adventures safe and sound and unharmed.

But we also have a cherry on top for you *(what's a survival kit without, right? ;)* <br>
Here it comes.. say ahhh!

###Rails Girls Summer of Code Slides for you!

A big thank you to [Floor](http://twitter.com/floordrees), who put them together and a lot of love into them.
They look amazing and include everything you need to have for your talk. Wonderful, right?

###Speaker Coaches coach you to speak
