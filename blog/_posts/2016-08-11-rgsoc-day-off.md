We’re almost halfway through the summer, which as every year can only mean one thing: It’s time for the official RGSoC Day Off!

What’s the RGSoC Day Off, you say?  
Every year, we encourage our participants to take a day off to decompress, relax, and come back to work ready for the second half of the program; this ensures that they have some time they can spend away from the computer and do anything they feel like doing on that weekday. This year, our official RGSoC day off will take place on **August 19th**.

For some students, the Day Off just means “not coding”; for others, it’s the possibility to try doing something new and exciting or to spend the day outdoors and with friends. If you need some ideas on what to do on your very own day off, we’ve collected some [here](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/rgsoc-day-off); our teams in the past have gone swimming, hiking, baked cakes, or just hung out with their family. However, you can really just do whatever you want: The sky is the limit!  
The only rule is: no work, no commits, no learning code for that single day. We know it's difficult, but we also hope you can follow through ;)

If you want to document your day off, you can use the **#rgsocdayoff** hashtag and post tweets or pictures of your day. But hey, you don’t have to — it *is* a day off after all. 

On this note: We wish you a lot of fun on your official RGSoC Day Off!
