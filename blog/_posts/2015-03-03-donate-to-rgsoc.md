The Rails Girls Summer of Code crowdfunding campaign
is officially open! And you
thought that christmas only came ONCE a year! ;) We're opening up our campaign
page to the wider public today, so spread the word and
[donate](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/)!



### No amount is too little!

Over the last two years we've learned quite a lot about how to run a global fellowship
program. However, one thing has always been consistent; the generous support (both financial and otherwise) of the programming and technology community.

Whether you have a little, or a whole lot to give, every cent raised makes a huge difference to
creating a bigger and more expansive program in 2015.

If you want to sponsor a larger amount, take a look at our [sponsor packages](/sponsors/packages)
 and [guidelines](/sponsorship-guidelines).

### The Early Birds

Over the last few months we've been talking to some of our most ardent supporters
to get on board with some early sponsorship. Many thanks to our [earlybird sponsors](/sponsors),
Travis CI, GitHub, SoundCloud, Google Open Source, Basecamp, Turing School of Software and Design, Keen IO,
Site5, and TeaLeaf Academy for supporting us with their sponsorship before we even opened
our crowd funding campaign!

To top it off, a number are even coming back for
their [second](http://2014.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/sponsors/) or [third year](http://2013.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/sponsors-thanks/) of sponsorship! Not only do these early bird sponsors ensure that
our crowd funding can really start with a bang, but also to remind us
of the consistent help we've had from the tech community in making Rails Girls Summer of
Code a reality.
