[6wunderkinder](http://www.6wunderkinder.com/), [Envato](http://www.envato.com/) and [Springest](http://www.springest.co.uk/) support our Summer of Code by being [Coaching Companies](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/coaching-companies/), a role we defined for this year's edition as we noticed that some of last year’s most successful student teams have been supported greatly by local coaching companies. Companies like SoundCloud, who provided a place to work and a pool of coaches to help out two student teams at their Berlin office, inspired us to formalize this role.

Having the exposure to a productive work environment and ready access to coaches, greatly helps our students get the most out of their summer! And the other way around, a Coaching Company brings in talented people, excited to learn as much as they possibly can. Their fresh take on projects, and possibly unorthodox questions, are a valuable asset. Plus: you get to actively support the Open Source community.

We are excited to have 6wunderkinder (Berlin, Germany), Envato (Melbourne, Australia) and Springest (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) on board. And all three of them just sent an email to the Summer of Code team about how they wanted to support Rails Girls Summer of Code in a more 'offline' way. 

Last year, our dear friends at SoundCloud offered coaching and space to our students and besides that it was a big success for everyone involved, they clearly had some fun (and cookies!).

**Did you know that** being a Coaching Company means that coaches employed by the company will have to prepare one (or many) team’s application together with the students. If you are thinking about applying to Rails Girls Summer of Code, it might just be a good idea to [register at our teams app]( http://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/), to find a coach at either of these companies.



**Chad Fowler**, CTO at 6Wunderkinder:
*"We are excited to do anything we possibly can for Rails Girls Summer of Code. Looking forward to this summer!"*

[Chad](https://twitter.com/chadfowler) coincidentally is also a member of the organizing team behind Rails Girls Summer of Code.   

**Collis** Ta'eed, Envato is also super excited to offer some help to future Rails Girls students in Down Under: *"We have [a lovely creative office in the heart of Melbourne](http://inside.envato.com/envato-office-tour/) with plenty of desks, and we can offer some coaching support ready to go"*

Envato is also one of our Early Bird sponsors. And they have some [great video tutorials about Ruby](http://hub.tutsplus.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bkeywords%5D=Ruby&button=). Just saying.   
 
Do you have free space for at least a one to two-person team to work? Do have developers passionate about helping newcomers, and working on Open Source? You might just have what it takes to be a Coaching Company. Do register your company by emailing us: summer-of-code@railsgirls.com.
