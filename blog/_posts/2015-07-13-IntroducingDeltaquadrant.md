Hello! We are Maren and Julia of [Team Delta Quadrant](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/23). We'll work on [Diaspora*](https://diasporafoundation.org).

**_Why “Team Delta Quadrant”, what does it mean?_**


_Julia_: I’m a Star Trek fan! [Voyager](http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager) is my favourite Star Trek Series and is really worth watching. It’s about [Captain Janeways](http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Kathryn_Janeway) crew getting lost in the [Delta Quadrant.](http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Delta_Quadrant) which means 70 years away from earth (Alpha Quadrant) and their search for a way home. That was the inspiration for the team name.


**_How did you hear about the SoC and why did you apply?_**

_Julia_: A friend of mine went to the Rails Girls Beginners' workshop and told me afterwards about this cool summer programme, that I should apply for. Currently I’m in my last year of university (studying applied computer sciences) so it is nearly time to find a ‘real’ job. But I didn’t feel ready yet for a developer position so three months of intense coding would be excellent!
I teamed up with my friend [Lucie](https://twitter.com/Autofocus). A few days before the application closed I had to heavy-heartedly part with Lucie since she got an amazing job offer. I didn’t really think that I could find someone else with only two days left to meet the deadline but I [tweeded anyways](https://twitter.com/anderspree/status/586940329649184769). And that’s how I met Maren :)


_Maren_: I am part of one of the [Rubymonstas](http://rubymonstas.org/) one of the first Rails Girls Berlin learning groups. Sven Fuchs one of our coaches was one of the initiators of Rails Girls Summer of Code. So I saw it developing over the last years. Last year I was already part of the programme as a mentor of [speakerinnen.org](www.speakerinnen.org). This year I saw [Julia’s tweet](https://twitter.com/anderspree/status/586940329649184769) as she was spontaneously looking for a new pair to work with. I think it was fate :) - two days before the deadline. I finally applied because I wanted to spend more time coding as I did until now. On the one hand to have more time to learn and on the other hand to get more routine in coding. 

**_What project are you working on?_**

We are working on [diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) - a decentralized and privacy oriented social network. We picked some open issues that we will work on during the next months: show the geo-location of a user on an Open Street Map, improve picture uploading, create a moderator role and improve the interaction with the tumblr API. We published our project plan [here]( https://github.com/TeamDeltaQuadrant/project_plan/blob/master/plan.md).

**_What are you most looking forward to this summer?_**

We are very happy to have the opportunity and the luxury to spend a lot of time on learning new things and to improve our programming skills and routines. We also like working in a team with different people and so we are really looking forward to work with our lovely coaches [Andi](https://twitter.com/A5308Y), [Bastian]( https://twitter.com/bastianalbers) and [Finn](https://twitter.com/finnpauls), our mentor [Lisa](https://wk3.org/people/97af6df26ecc6c55) our special-supporter and diaspora developer [Christophe]( https://wk3.org/people/6afb9a20cafd8f6d) and our supervisor [Verena](https://twitter.com/viddity). Not to forget [Aakriti](https://twitter.com/aakritiagupta) and [Timo](https://twitter.com/troessner) who offer us desk space and support in their office at [blacklane](https://www.blacklane.com/)!
