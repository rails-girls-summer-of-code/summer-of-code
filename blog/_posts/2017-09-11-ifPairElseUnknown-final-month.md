### __Update on our project__

We are in our final month of RGSoC! We can’t believe RGSoC is nearing the end. We have learnt so much since we started and are feeling more confident in pursuing a career in Development.

Working out of the office at our host company Zendesk, has been a great experience. We have met many wonderful and supportive peers.
We spent our first two months hanging out with Adel Smee and her team. For a few weeks we have moved to another floor to sit amongst Zendesk’s Data Scientists and Data Engineers.
During our time here we have participated in a regular Monday morning meditation session, enjoyed many Tech Talks, attended a communication workshop and participated in an ice cream day.

We have been contributing towards [if-me.org,](https://www.if-me.org/) an open source project founded by [Julia Nguyen](https://twitter.com/fleurchild). We have been inspired by Julia’s passion towards building a community for sharing mental health experiences and providing support.

We have managed the project using Trello, Github and hosting a global meeting with our team each week.
With the support and guidance of Julia and our coaches we have completed a number of issues assigned to us on Github.

By the end of RGSoC, we will have done:

#### __What we have learnt__

__Pair Programming__ - Two brains are better than one and four eyes are better than two! We set up our environment with; 2 monitors, 2 keyboards and 2 mice/trackpads which has helped us write efficiently and keep us engaged while pair programming.

__Git__ - The world of Git is never ending. Branches and branches and branches are unlimited and then remembering to merge and rebase and reconnect to the main branch. The Git journey has taken us to many places with a rebase back to home.

__Ruby__ - There are more than one way to solve a problem. Ruby has helped us to do it in a way that is readable!

__Rails__ - Rails is a framework which has provided structure and simplified repetitive tasks. It’s also pretty magical.

__Javascript__ - Javascript likes its semi-colons ‘;’ and ‘;’! And don’t forget the commas!

__TDD__ - We regularly wrote tests within our code base. When it come to building an application we can’t live without TDD. As we have now a better understanding of TDD, our lives will never the same.

There is an endless number of applications and developer tools available to us and the more we learn, the more we realise we don’t know enough and learning never stops.


#### __Challenges we faced__

This has been our first contribution to an open source project. It wasn’t easy diving into an established project. There was a lot to learn and discover. We had to navigate through all the files of existing code.

Getting the hang of Git was a bit of a challenge. We discovered that we could cause a conflict in Git when both working together on the same branch.

Pair programming can be challenging when working remotely. We worked remotely for 9 days and found it challenging because we were both working in different timezones and often had issues with internet connection.

#### __What's next?__

Our plans/goals for after RGSoC:

We plan to develop on our existing programming skills, with the aim to become full time developers. We would like to share our experience participating in RGSoC with others, in the hope that this will encourage more diversity within the industry. We look forward to attending the [Ruby Australia Conference](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/2018) in 2018.
