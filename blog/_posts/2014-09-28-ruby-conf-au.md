## ... and The Spree Girls are going!
The wonderful [RubyConf Australia](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/2015) organizing team decided to gift our Sydney-based volunteer team, [Tracy and Catherine of The Spree Girls](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/spree-girls-downunder/) tickets to their conference, taking place early February next year.

All the conference sessions will be held at the amazing Deakin Edge theatre
in Federation Square Melbourne CBD.

With Rails Girls very own [Linda Luikas](https://twitter.com/lindaliukas), the amazing [Rachel Myers](https://twitter.com/rachelmyers) and [Sarah Mei](https://twitter.com/sarahmei) amongst the currently confirmed speakers, we're certain our team down-under will have a great time.

Fun fact: RubyConf Australia is hosting a Rails Girls workshop as part of their program. Follow [@railsgirls_au](https://twitter.com/RailsGirls_AU) for updates on that.

Travelling to Australia for RubyConf? Make sure you give those SpreeGirls a big hug from us!
