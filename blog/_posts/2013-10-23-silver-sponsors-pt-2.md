[Last week,](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/silver-sponsors-pt-1/) we presented the first five of our remarkable silver sponsors. Now you can learn more about the other half. These generous guys make RGSoC possible; we think they’re pretty awesome!

<a href="http://www.envato.com/"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1408492/b4a7df24-3d82-11e3-9ad7-91436b528217.png" width="200"></a>
**“Envato is the Australian company behind an ecosystem of sites that helps millions of people earn and learn. We love summer, Rails, and supporting women in the tech community, which makes Rails Girls Summer of Code & Envato a match made in Internet heaven.”** We agree, thanks Envato, you've helped us a lot starting step by step to make the Open Source community even better!

<a href="http://www.innoq.com/de"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1408508/01e7d0e6-3d83-11e3-9e06-e2d9b73912a6.png" width="200"></a>
**“innoQ is a consulting/software development firm with a focus on technology and architecture, and we maintain a very engineering-oriented company culture among our around 60 people. (...) with our involvement we want to achieve two things: Send a clear message about our attitude towards women in tech (we’re welcoming them), and do a small part in increasing the number of women who consider a career in tech in the first place.”** innoQ has also been involved with numerous Rails Girls events by hosting and providing coaches. We are lucky to now also have them as sponsors!

<a href="http://gnip.com/"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1408518/190451be-3d83-11e3-8b99-573eb9fd26b6.png" width="200"></a>
Gnip makes the **“ever/expanding universe of social media data available via a consistent and reliable architecture so the world can realize the full potential of this amazing stream of information.”** Located in Boulder, Colorado, the company won the Best Place to Work award in 2012, and this summer also won over our hearts with their donation. You rock, Gnip!

<a href="http://www.groupon.com/"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1408521/3793a1ca-3d83-11e3-9642-bd5352cb891f.png" width="200"></a>
At this point everyone knows Groupon, they are **“a global leader in local commerce, making it easy for people around the world to search and discover great businesses at unbeatable prices.” But did you know that Groupon also have Women in Engineering and Employee Resource Groups like Women@Groupon and Pride@Groupon in order to **“foster diversity at work”**, especially in the tech scene? They donated to RGSoC because it aligned with their core values, those of supporting women and increasing diversity. Groupon is **“happy to support dreams coming true”** and after such a successful summer, we can say that you have!

<a href="http://www.shopify.com/"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1408529/4a71ded8-3d83-11e3-9289-e267cddc3536.png" width="200"></a>
**“At Shopify, we help emerging small businesses get off the ground and grow into successful companies. We do this by creating great technology and by making it accessible to people that previously wouldn’t be able to afford it.”** With their silver donation, Shopify also supports women in tech and helps them grow into successful programmers! 

<a href="http://supadupa.me/)"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1711357/1408535/5da7416e-3d83-11e3-8366-fae29e14c5d8.png" width="200"></a>
SupaDupa is a **“premium affordable boutique e-commerce platform aimed at people with an uncompromising eye for design who have one or many products to sell.”** As their story goes, **“almost two years ago SupaDupa was a flimsy idea with barely a leg to stand on!”** Hmmm sounds like the early days of the RGSoC, and without amazing sponsors like you, we wouldn’t be here! You guys are supa!(...dupa)

Thanks sponsors, and keep supporting women in tech!
