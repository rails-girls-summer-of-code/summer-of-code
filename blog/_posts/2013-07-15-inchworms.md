I guess you are as curious as we are about our teams, right?

So from now on every week we'll present a team to you that will tell us a little bit about themselves, what awesome stuff they are up to and how things are going.

Later today we are beginning with the Berlin based <a href="http://inchworms.net/blog/">Team Inchworms</a>. Stay tuned to learn more about Sinatra, what Carla and Anja's happiest moment was so far and how they came to their team name.
