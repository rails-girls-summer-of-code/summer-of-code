[Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org) is an open source company, based in beautiful Berlin. They build a hosted continuous integration service which is integrated with GitHub and supports a multitude of programming languages, like Python, Go, PHP, Java, C++... and of course Ruby! And I think it's fair to say that without Travis, there would not have been a Rails Girls Summer of Code, as they took on lead support and organization. 

[Anika](https://twitter.com/langziehohr) - from now on referred to as 'Chief Spread the Word' of Rails Girls Summer of Code - wrote a cool post on the Travis blog the other day, on how our 'founders' went from ['dream to 19 scholarships in under 3 months'](http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/2013-09-05-travis-and-rails-girls-summer-of-code/). Which is indeed a huge accomplishment and worthy of a BIG thank you!

[Team Inchworms](https://twitter.com/inchworms_) found a suitable way to thank the Travis CI team for their efforts *(spoiler alert: they [baked a Travis CI cake](http://inchworms.net/travis) and there are awesome gifs involved!!*)<br>

It's truly amazing what happened after [Sven](https://twitter.com/svenfuchs) gave a lightning talk at a [Rails Girls Berlin workshop](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/2013/04/01/review-follow-up-workshop-march-2013/) at [Wooga](http://www.wooga.com/) in late March. The idea to organize a Summer of Code to get more women in open source spread like wildfire. Sven has been working on getting RGSoC off the ground and the whole Travis team contributed - [Konstantin](https://twitter.com/konstantinhaase) is even a mentor of Team Inchworms, who work on Sinatra.

We love Travis.
