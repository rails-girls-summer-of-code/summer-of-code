### All are repeat sponsors for second year in a row.

This year's gold supporters are all returning sponsors. We're so happy to have their continued support, both financially and for their continued interest in making the program the best it can be!

Recognizing the vital role that open source software plays at Google, [Google](https://developers.google.com/) heavily supports the open source software development community. One of the ways they do this is by running student outreach programs such as Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in. It's no secret that Rails Girls Summer of Code is loosely based on [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/), a global program that offers student developers to write code for various open source software projects.  Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together over 7,500 successful student participants and over 7,000 mentors from over 100 countries worldwide to produce over 50 million lines of code.

The wonderful people at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) get real excited about the challenge of bringing all the world's sounds to the internet. With everyone at SoundCloud being a hacker at heart, they host company [We Hack](http://blog.soundcloud.com/2012/08/20/we-hack/) weekends as well as [Hacker Time](http://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/stop-hacker-time) (much like the 20% time concept made famous by Google) for their engineering team. SoundCloud believes that life gets boring if you don't keep learning - and we couldn't agree more! We bet that's why they are the biggest evangelists for our program and offered to be a [coaching company](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching-company/) no less!

Erik Michaels-Ober and Duana Stanley from SoundCloud on their support:
*"SoundCloud is incredibly proud to support the Rails Girls Summer of Code for the second year in a row. We've already started to see the impact that sponsoring and coaching Rails Girls can make in these womens' lives and careers. For us, this is an investment in the future of our industry."*

<a href="https://basecamp.com/"><img src="/img/sponsors/basecamp.png" width="450"></a>

Last year (back then still under the 37signals flag) [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) was on early in the program. Spread out across 26 different cities around the world, Basecamp is a distributed community of designers, programmers, tinkerers, writers, speakers, analysts, ... a bit of everything really. 2014 marks their 15th year in business (happy , Basecamp!), yet their goals remain the same - and fit amazingly well to Rails Girls Summer of Code: *"Have fun, do exceptional work, build the best product in the business, experiment, pay attention to the details, treat people right, tell the truth, have a positive impact on the world around us, give back, and keep learning."*

Oh, and we love their [team page](https://basecamp.com/team).

Andrea LaRowe from Basecamp on their support:
*"Basecamp is the world's #1 project management tool.  For the last ten years, companies have been switching to Basecamp because it's famously easy to use, reliable, and it has the best customer service in the biz!  We're sponsoring RGSoC because we are excited to help a worldwide community of women "learn by doing" while meaningfully contributing to quality open source projects."*
