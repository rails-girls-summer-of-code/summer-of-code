We'd like to thank everyone who send in an application, the quality of
submissions was exceptionally high this year. The selection team had a tough 3
days deciding which teams will spend their summer coding on a number of
outstanding Open Source projects. Without further ado, we'd like you to meet
the teams:

will be their primary coach, and Rails Girls veteran

[Carolina](https://github.com/carolinagc),

now be their mentors. Find the project proposal
