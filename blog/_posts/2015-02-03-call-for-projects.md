It's only February, but the whole team is already hard at work to make the upcoming Summer of Code the best one yet! In order to do this we need you. <strong>Yes, you, awesome-project-maintainer</strong>! Last year we had a huge variety of projects our students got to work on such as Bundler, Spree, Species+, and Rubinius; for each project, one or more maintainers were "project mentors": the go-to people if students had questions that were specifically about the project. We want to make this happen in 2015, too. For this we want <strong>you and your project</strong> on board!
We've made it super-duper easy for you and put together a small and handy guide to submitting your project for the Summer of Code. [Here it is](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/)! It will hopefully answer most of your questions; and if it doesn't and you are still confused about something, don't hesitate to get in touch.


Start right now and read [how to propose your project](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects) - we simply CAN NOT WAIT to get your submissions!
