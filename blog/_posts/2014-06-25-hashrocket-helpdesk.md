[We recently announced](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2014-06-19-tealeaf-helpdesk/) how a bunch of awesome Tealeaf students and alumni will help this year's Rails Girls Summer of Code participants get the answers-they-need. Today we are excited to share that [Hashrocket](http://hashrocket.com/) will also be joining our helpdesk team on [Campfire](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.campfirenow.com/33c5b). Committing to 10 hours per week for the entire span of the program, at least one Hashrocketeer will hang out in our support room between 14:00 and 22:00 UTC - every day!

[Joshua - Josh - Davey](https://twitter.com/joshuadavey) from Hashrocket on their involvement:
*"Rails Girls Summer of Code is something we've been following, and we are really happy to be a part of the program this year. We're excited to help the students learn more about Rails and see the cool projects that come out of the program."*

And that's not all. Hashrocket supports Rails Girls Summer of Code as a Silver sponsor AND offered to be a [Coaching Company](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching-company/). Hashrocket builds solutions for the Web, iPhone and iPad, and specializes in Ruby on Rails, iOS and Android development. Again, It's great to have them help us out!

### Please join us!

We are always looking for more people to join the helpdesk.

In case you are interested, please register via our [Teams application](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) and specify your role as "Helping as a remote coach (helpdesk)". Then sign in to our [Campfire chat room](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.campfirenow.com/33c5b), and you're good to go!
