This year’s program has started off with a bang! As today marks the start of the fourth week of RGSoC, we thought you would be interested in seeing what our amazing teams have been doing since the first day of our program.

From enjoying Global Kick-off events to having their kick-off calls with team members, from making their first pull request to preparing for conferences, our students are ready to mark their presence in the open source world.
