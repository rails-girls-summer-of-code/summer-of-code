Way back in April our coach, Jessica, had organized Rails Girls LA. Jen was coaching and Joyce was in attendance. Joyce really connected with her pair and coach while Jen was inspired by the new crew of women. 

Post Rails Girls workshop, we were both part of the same weekly Ruby/Rails study group which really kept us rolling.  Itâ€™s nice to have people tell you to calm your horses when you have freak out moments. A few of us started working on an app. together when the word went out about RGSoC. 

As part of the Bundler core team, Jessica already had Bundler in mind as a project so we jumped at her offer. This allowed us to take what we already knew and apply it to a real open-source project,  one small edit at a time. We were happy to get the opportunity to delve more into coding with the help of a coach and mentor! 

We ended up working on the most used gem in Ruby/Rails: Bundler! It is not glamorous, but very important. It is probably something you don't even think about much past `bundle install` or `bundle update` because it is just part of the fabric of Rails. In the dark ages of Rails, developers would have to stand in the snow, manually installing the dependent gems for each project and then hope their project didn't fail as gems were updated to newer versions. Now bundler "magically" makes sure everything is working in your favor. We have been working to help keep that seamless effect still seem magical.

We have worked on the bundler website, [http://bundler.io](http://bundler.io), to make the documentation easier to access and to read. Lately we have been working on adding features and fixing problems that users have encountered. One of the happiest moments was seeing our fixes merged into Bundler! It is incredibly satisfying especially our first merges! Our mentor Andre Arko has also been incredibly helpful in our pursuits. Plus, he gave us awesome Bundler t-shirts when we met him at the Distill conference in San Francisco. Thanks so much to everyone who has made this possible. XO Rails Girls LA - Team Bundler
