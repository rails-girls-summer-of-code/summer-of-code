### Congratulations!

You should have all already been introduced to your respective conference organisers; and as always, we're happy to introduce first-time (and even second-time) conference goers to people from the local Rails Girls community. If you need to be introduced, let us know - we can try connecting you. For those of you giving lightning talks, we always have those [tips](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/talk/) and [tricks](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2014-07-29-talk-tips/) handy so you can rock that stage! Don't forget to take pictures and, most importantly: have fun! 

Last but not least: We’d like to thank again all of the conferences who offered tickets for our second round conference raffle:
