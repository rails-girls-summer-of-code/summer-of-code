Hi there! As the end of the application process is just around the corner (May 2nd), we thought we might update you on the status of the crowdfunding campaign. But let us give you the tl;dr version first:

<a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/"><img src="/img/blog/2014/final-spurt-rgsoc_beggars_small.jpg" width="600"></a>

[Donate now](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/)!

So let's see what happened in the last 27 days. We’ve updated our progress bar, with the help of our designer [Rebecca](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/rebecca/) and we love it:

… and as you can see we are halfway on the road to support 20 students (10 teams) to work on a Open Source project of their choosing this summer. [Help us fund those last teams!](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/)

We are detemined to help our students have an amazing experience like for example [Laura](http://railsgrrls.tumblr.com/) had. She was a student last year:
*"Last summer changed my life. I never expected this and now i’m moving to Hamburg to work as a graduate developer at ThoughtWorks. I couldn't have done it without the Rails Girls Summer of Code and my mentors."*

Last week we received so much support and kind words from our community - we’re still blushing! The wonderful [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/152-rr-the-new-york-times-and-ruby-with-jacqui-maher/) mentioned us in their podcast, and so did [Scotty and John from ideveloper.co.](http://ideveloper.co/podcast110/) Jen Myers (also one of our Trust Comittee members) [talked about Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvbx7CLV6nI&feature=youtu.be) to Mike from UGTASTIC at RailsConf. We were also mentioned as the [‘web tip’](http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1737477) of the week on fm4 (awesome radio station you should check out nevertheless) and… guess who was featured (twice!) in [The Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/issues/190)?! Spoiler alert: it’s us! Plus, we love every single support tweet from you, especially when there’s a lot of hearts in them:

So we guess the only thing left to say is this:

**[Join our supporters today](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) and help us reach our goal this week!!!1!!1**
