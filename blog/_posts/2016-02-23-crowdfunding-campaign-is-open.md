The days are getting longer, the sun is a little more visible in the winter sky, and with spring nearing, we’re glad to announce there’s an even better reason to rejoice: [Our crowdfunding campaign is open](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/)!

### A little earlier every year

Since its inception in 2013, our program has grown from a grassroots movement to a program involving all in all over 700 people — with a bigger impact on the Open Source community every year. In 2015 [we broke all our records](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/2015/12/02/record-breaking-rgsoc/) and could fund not 10, but 16 teams! We’ve even managed to open the campaign a little earlier every year, giving more sponsors the opportunity to support us from the very beginning.

### Our early birds

In the last few weeks, we’ve been reaching out to some of our most faithful supporters; the early donations of these 19 (!!!) sponsors and partners, and their support, have helped to get this campaign started with a bang.

We’re amazed — sparkles-in-our-eyes, jaw-dropping kind of amazed — to see how much of our goal we’ve already reached. Six teams are already funded — let's keep this momentum going!

### donatebecause

Last year, with the hashtag #donatebecause, we encouraged our community to donate for our last stretch goal, towards funding extra teams. This year, we’re asking you from the beginning to donate, because:  

**We know you can help us make a difference. Even the smallest amount helps!**   

<!--<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How about helping <a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC">@RailsGirlsSoC</a> fund one more team before the May Day? <a href="http://t.co/3KCo5Dqb5v">http://t.co/3KCo5Dqb5v</a> Please <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/donatebecause?src=hash">#donatebecause</a> <a href="http://t.co/yzqD8IsPUo">pic.twitter.com/yzqD8IsPUo</a></p>&mdash; Piotr Szotkowski (@chastell) <a href="https://twitter.com/chastell/status/593398292261777408">April 29, 2015</a></blockquote>  -->

We can’t wait to meet all of the teams we will be able to fund this year, and we're always so incredibly happy about every little donation that comes in. No amount is too small, and your money will go towards a great initiative to help awesome women learn and code during the summer.  

So, what are you waiting for? Donate to our [crowdfunding campaign](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) today, and help us make a difference in our Open Source Community! <3
