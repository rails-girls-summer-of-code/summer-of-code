*time to meet the crowd* &hearts;

At Rails Girls Summer of Code you work hard and learn new stuff every day, for
3 months, a summer full of love and code.

To make this an even more complete experience for you we'd like you to join a
nice conference. Enjoy the great vibe, learn a few new things from the talks, chat with fantastic people and get to know the lovely community!

For this we have been offered no less than **55 free tickets** at fantastic
conferences on 3 different continents for you. On top of that some conferences
even include **free flights and hotel**, too. And all of them are very worth
visiting!

**Everyone** who has applied for Rails Girls Summer of Code as a student **can apply for this**, no matter if your application has been selected.

Please read more here:
