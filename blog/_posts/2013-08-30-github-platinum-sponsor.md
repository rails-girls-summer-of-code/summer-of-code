Hands up, who hasn't heard of GitHub? We probably won't see that many raising theirs. For those who are new to all these development details, here is what GitHub [writes about themselves:](https://github.com/about)

*"GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over three million people use GitHub to build amazing things together."*

What this really means is that more than \_three million people\_ store their code in one place. This is neat because cooperation on projects suddenly becomes so much easier. You can search for projects, learn from other users' code, fix their bugs or finish their features. And you can do all of this without having to ask for write access to the repository first or sending patches via email.

At the same time, GitHub is also a bit of a marketplace. It's great to be able to take a look at the source of a gem or library when you think about what you want to use. You can find collections of useful snippets, and share your own. And it's a fab place to show the world what you're tinkering with.

For some, GitHub now almost equals open source development. That's also because GitHub has made git much less intimidating, and turned it into something accessible to mere mortals. Just check out their [help section](https://help.github.com/)!

Of course, all Rails Girls Summer of Code teams have public repositories on GitHub to securely store – and version control! – their hard work.

Most importantly for us, GitHub generously supports Rails Girls Summer of Code with a platinum sponsorship which helps a bunch of dedicated women to get deeper into coding and open source projects - how wonderful is that!
Alicja & Wictoria from [Team Species+](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/7) have something special to say:
