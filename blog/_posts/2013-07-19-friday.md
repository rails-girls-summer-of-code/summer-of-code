It's friday and here is a hug:

This is our favorite FRIDAYHUG so far from Team Species+. On their [blog] (http://dalach.blogspot.de/search/label/RGSoC) you can find other friday hugs, read about if working in caf√©s ... well works and how they use d3.js.

This week, Konstantin Haase wrote down HTTP for Team Inchworms with [pen and paper](http://inchworms.net/blog/2013-07-18-get-requests/) (!).
Team Bundler started [their summer of code](http://rgsocbundler.github.io/2013/06/30/hello-world.html) and Team Highway to Rails [ripped up another to-do index card ](http://highwaytorails.tumblr.com/post/55700336007/day-12-17-7-2013-nesting-resources).

Also, one of our dear sponsors, Soundcloud, interviewed [Team Rails Grrls](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/3) on their [blog](http://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/07/19/rails-girls-summer-of-code-welcoming-nicole-and-laura/).

 WOW, we feel super amazed and proud to see one of our teams getting 10:48 min of fame. &hearts;

But this is only a few of what has been going on this week. Check out more here: [teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org](teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org).

Good friday, everyone!
