We are three weeks into the program and it’s that time of the summer again for.. Yes, you’ve guessed it: our first conference raffle!

As in the last [two](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/conference/) [years](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2014-06-09-conference-tickets/), some pretty wonderful conferences have donated free team tickets for you, dear RGSoC students. Attending conferences is one of our favourite things about the field we work in: we just love the conference vibe, meeting new people (and old friends), and sipping coffee while learning tons about Ruby, web development, and the newest tools out there. We think this is one of the most [valuable experiences](http://rapidrailsgirls.weebly.com/home/baruco) for newcomers – and we want our students to witness that exhilarating conference vibe, too!

#### Our selected conferences  
As of now, we have over 30 tickets to give away for 13 conferences located all around the world. We are incredibly grateful to these conferences and their amazing organisers, who put a lot of effort and hard work into making these events happen and into making them accessible to everyone. We’re glad to have them support us in promoting diversity in tech, and they deserve all the love in the world <3
