So long and (and no thanks for the
[externalities](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1719050) goodbye! Rails Girls Summer of Code
2015 has come to an end, and, as it has always been, it has been a sad farewell.
For 3 months, we have been coding and learning evything that we could about
this amazing world that coding is. We have not only learnt that coding is
fun but also that the people who code is perhaps the most kind and most
willing-to-help people on the world. Throughout this 3 incredible months we
have got in touch with people from all over the world who, without any kind of
compensation, was always been there to help. So for everything that has been
done and taught, thank you all!

## Soo... how was it?

FYI, we were (well, actually, we ‘are’) TeamRubyGirlsQuito from Quito, Ecuador. Our
work was to implement Braintree Payment gateaway, allow Bitcoin payments and
implement a deactivate button for the amazing LEAP web app. And even though, we
knew nothing about crypto currencies and payment’s gateways, we managed to learn
everything about them (well, maybe not everything, but, at least, a lot).
Working with LEAP was, in a word, amazing. It was like a dream come true to work
on an application that works with encryption and, so far, it has motivated us to
learn more about encryption (or, al least, to read a lot of books about
cryptography). So, we think that Rails Girls Summer of Code is one the most
amazing experiences we will ever have. We know that all of the things that we
learnt on this summer, all of the people we met, and all of the nights and days
we spent coding will be part of our fondest life memories! :)

But apart from everything that was learnt (git, Rails, the evil haml,
javascript, bitcoin functionality, Braintree functionality, etc.) we had a
really great time while meeting people from all over the world. Even though, we
only had one amazing coach (having Batman is always enough!), we got help from a
variety of people. We couldn’t be more thankful for the help that was given:
from Erlang’s master [Dave Cottlehuber](https://twitter.com/dch__) from whom we
learnt that MacPorts are the evil and should not never (NEVER) be used, from
stackoverflow’s boy [Raki](https://twitter.com/rakib312), who helped us even though
we only met him at Stack, to Colombia’s rails core member [Guillermo Iguaran]
(https://twitter.com/guilleiguaran) (thanks so much for all the tutorials,
for all the amazing discussions about logic, Turing and Hilbert, and for all
of the sleepless-nights in which you helped us to understand ‘fake-braintree’).
Thanks to LEAP guys (Thorsten, Azul, Elijah, Klaus and Christoph) for
everything... You’re, indeed, amazing! Thanks to the Rails Girls Summer of Code
and ThoughtWorks! And of course, thanks so much to our amazing only coach,
Batman! As the “real” Batman would say:

>"a hero can be anyone. Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as
putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know that the world
hadn't ended". (You're our hero ;) )

Soo.. Thanks so much!! RGSoC has taught us not only how to code but also that
there is people building a better world while coding, who we will always give
help to whoever needs it. And, lastly, it has taught us that no matter how
many bugs there are, no matter how many nights you haven’t slept and no matter
how many dreams you had about your code, at the end of the day to see
your code complete and useful is, in a word, priceless.
