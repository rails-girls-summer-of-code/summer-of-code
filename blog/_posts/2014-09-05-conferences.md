What to do at the conference?
=====
First of all, we want you to be amazed and inspired. A conference is one of the best places to learn heaps of stuff and talk to wonderful people.

Additionally, why not amaze the other attendees? We would love for you to share your Summer of Code story and spread the word to even more seasoned programmers about the great opportunities of the Rails Girls. Many conferences have slots for lightning talks. Not sure how to tackle the task? We have just [the blog post](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2014-07-29-talk-tips/) for you!

And now go, go, GO for those tickets.
Good luck!
