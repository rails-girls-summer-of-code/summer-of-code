Last week, you sent us your conference wishlists via twitter, and the Conference Raffle Fairy Godmothers (Anika, Katrin, Sara and yours truly) sat down to – in true conference raffle fashion – pull out your team names from a jar and assign conferences to teams. This is what it looked like!

### Congratulations!

It’s now time to get booking your flights and accommodation and to get ready to have the time of your life at these amazing conferences. We have some tips on [how to rock that conference](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/conference-tips/) plus [tips](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/talk/) and [tricks](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2014-07-29-talk-tips/) for those who will be giving lightning talks! We will of course introduce all students to the conference organisers, but should you want to meet some people from the local Rails Girls community, let us know! We’ll try our best to connect you. 

And if you ended up empty-handed, worry not! We will have a second raffle in August with more conferences. On this note, we’d like to thank again all of the conferences who offered tickets for our first round conference raffle:
