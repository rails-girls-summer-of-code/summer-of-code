<h4>A note on Conferences</h4>
<p>In the past we collaborated with conferences all over the world, offering students a chance to attend for free. While recognizing the excellent opportunity for networking and development this offers, we‚Äôve decided not to run this part of the program in 2020.</p>

<p>However, you may be able to source tickets to conferences via our friends at <a href="https://diversitytickets.org/en" target="_blank">Diversity Tickets</a>.</p>
