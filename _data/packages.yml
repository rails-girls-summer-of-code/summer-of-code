      best exception monitoring service on the planet — in fact, it’s so awesome,
      you’ll want to get more errors in your application just so you can use it more!
      Built on Rails, it helps developers deliver great experiences to their users.
      We at Honeybadger love the open source community, and we are happy to sponsor
      RGSoC to help make that community even better.
