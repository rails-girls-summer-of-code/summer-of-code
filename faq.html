                        <h3>What is Rails Girls Summer of Code?</h3>
                        <div>
                          <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source.</p>
                          <p>Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students will be paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code).</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Who is running this?</h3>
                        <div>
                          <p>The idea for this project originated in a Berlin Rails Girls organizers and coaches meeting about exchanging ideas about "what's happening after the initial beginner's workshop" and what could be improved. One idea was to encourage students to get involved with open source projects. And so the idea for a summer of code was born.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Who can participate as a student?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>We're looking for women who have participated in any Rails Girls, RailsBridge, or similar newcomer workshop, have participate in a Ruby/Rails study group, or otherwise are getting started with Ruby/Rails as newcomers.</p>
                            <p>Unlike Google Summer of Code, no status as a student at a university is necessary, and there are certainly no degree or age limitations.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Where will Rails Girls Summer of Code take place?</h3>
                        <div>
                          <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is planned as a global event. Thus, it does not matter where a student or coach lives or where a company is located.</p>
                          <p>We will try to find coaches as near as possible to a students location to avoid the student having to accomodate herself in a different city. Ideally coaches can provide a desk at their own workplace so students can sit next to them, ask questions and get support.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>How much money will students receive?</h3>
                        <div>
                          <p>Has to be decided. GSoC paid 1500 USD a month, for 3 month.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Why are mentor and coach two separate roles?</h3>
                        <div>
                          <p>Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code each project needs at least one person who knows the project very well and can decide on directions, goals and tasks. This role has traditionally been named "mentors". </p>
                            <p>Unlike those programs Rails Girls Summer of Code has a primarily educational and motivational purpose though. Thus, students are going to be supported by coaches who will support and aid students in accomplishing their tasks. A coach should be located in the same city as the student is. Ideally they can share a desk so support is available at all times.</p>
                            <p>So, in Rails Girls Summer of Code mentors take the role of being the expert goto person on the project side. Coaches take the role of supporting students in learning and achieving the project goals.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>What does an ideal project goal look like?</h3>
                        <div>
