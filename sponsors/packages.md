# Sponsorship Packages

Rails Girls Summer of Code subsidizes programming newcomers to learn and work
on Open Source projects from July to September each year. You can help make this
a reality by sponsoring a package, or partnering with us.


{% include sponsor_packages.html %}


By providing this stipend, we enable students to dedicate themselves to their
Open Source learning projects full-time. As a sponsor, you are a crucial part of
providing the Summer of Code subsidies. Your sponsorship will enter a budget
pool, from which the selected students will be paid.

The program sees a huge amount of publicity from our student teams, coaches and
organizers: be it on Twitter, Facebook, blogs or at conferences and local developers
meet ups. It’s a great blend of marketing, and genuinely contributing to the
development community.

to offer, please get in touch: <a href="mailto:
summer-of-code@railsgirls.com">summer-of-code@railsgirls.com</a>.

### Your swag in student support packages

If you send us your swag (e.g. stickers, pens, notebooks or other things
that fit nicely with a Summer of Code learning project), we will include
it in a "care package" that will be sent out to each student. Pictures of the
contents of these packages often are tweeted and retweeted a lot.

### Your logo on slides at presentations about RGSoC

Students are strongly encouraged to give full talks or lightning talks at
conferences (many of which donate free tickets for them) as well as local
programming and tech meetups. Students tend to present their projects at these
meetups, and how Summer of Code is helping them do it. Some organizers also
present about the Summer of Code program as a whole.

All people presenting on behalf of or in conjunction with Summer of Code are
asked to include a slide with all Gold and Platinum sponsors'
logos at the beginning of their presentation.

### The Hall of Fame

Platinum (or bigger) sponsor logos for each year are kept on our "Hall of Fame" pages.
The pages list the teams that participated, projects contributed to, success
stories, and any truly special moments from the program.
