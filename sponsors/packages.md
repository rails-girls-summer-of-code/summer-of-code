    <h1>Become a Sponsor</h1>
    <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code enables women to learn and code
    on Open Source projects from July to September each year. You can help make this
    a reality by sponsoring a package or partnering with us.</p>

    <h2>Sponsorship Packages</h2>
    <p>Supporting RGSoC enables students to dedicate themselves to their
    Open Source learning projects full-time. As a sponsor, you are a crucial part of
    providing the Summer of Code subsidies. Your sponsorship will enter a budget
    pool, from which the selected students will be paid.</p>
    <p>If you would like to know more about RGSoC or present our program to your company, you can also take a look at this <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/langziehohr/rails-girls-summer-of-code-2016">pitch deck</a>.</p>

    <h3>Your swag in student support packages</h3>

    <p>If you send us your swag, we will include it in a “care package” that will be sent out to each student. Bronze sponsors are very welcome to send stickers, Silver sponsors and upwards may send additional swag (e.g. pens, notebooks, web-cam covers or other things that fit nicely with a Summer of Code learning project). </p>

    <h3>Your company in the Sponsor opportunity Newsletter</h3>

    <p>You may want to offer opportunities to our students such as (but not limited to) internships, interviews, special use of your service, invitations to events etc. </p>

    <p>We are collecting all these information and will display them in order of sponsorship packages in an informative letter that goes out to all our participants. </p>

    <h3>Your logo on slides at presentations about RGSoC</h3>

    <p>Students are strongly encouraged to give full talks or lightning talks at conferences (many of which donate free tickets for them) as well as local programming and tech meet ups. Students tend to present their projects at these meet ups, and how Summer of Code is helping them do it. Some organisers also present about the Summer of Code program as a whole.</p>

    <p>All people presenting on behalf of or in conjunction with Summer of Code are asked to include a slide with all Gold and Platinum sponsors’ logos at the beginning of their presentation.</p>

    <h3>The Hall of Fame</h3>

    <p>Platinum (or bigger) sponsor logos for each year are kept on our “Hall of Fame” pages. The pages list the teams that participated, projects contributed to, success stories, and any truly special moments from the program.</p>
