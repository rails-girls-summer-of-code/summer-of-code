    <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code enables women and non-binary people to work on Open Source projects from July to September each year while receiving a monthly scholarship. You can help make this a reality by becoming a Rails Girls Summer of Code sponsor or by donating as an individual.</p>
    
    <p>Our various sponsorship packages are detailed below.</p>

    <h2>Why you should become a sponsor</h2>

    <p>By sponsoring RGSoC, you will directly help individual women and non-binary people get into Open Source, but it also comes with benefits for the community at large.</p>

    <h2>Sponsorship Packages</h2>
    
    <p>Supporting RGSoC enables our students to dedicate themselves to their Open Source learning projects full-time because their living expenses are covered by a monthly stipend. As a sponsor, you play a crucial part in making this happen, funding the budget pool from which the selected students will be paid.</p>

    <p>If you would like to know more about RGSoC or present our program to your company, you can also take a look at our most recent <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/foundation/rgsoc-2020-sponsor-pitch" target="_blank">pitch deck</a>.</p>

    <p>Logos and links on the website will be sorted by package size and confirmation date of the donation.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or don’t feel this list quite represents what you have to offer, please get in touch: <a href="mailto: contact@rgsoc.org">contact@rgsoc.org.</a></p>

    <h3>Company swag in student support packages</h3>

    <p>If you send us your swag, we will include it in a “care package” that will be sent out to each student. Innovator and Pioneer sponsors are very welcome to send stickers or other small items that fit into an envelope. Trailblazer sponsors may send additional swag (e.g. pens, notebooks, webcam covers or other things that fit nicely with a Summer of Code learning project).</p>

    <h3>Your company in the Sponsor Opportunity Newsletter</h3>

    <p>You may want to offer opportunities to our students such as (but not limited to) internships, interviews, special use of your services, invitations to events etc.</p>

    <p>We are collecting all these offers and will display them in order of sponsorship packages in an informative newsletter, which goes out to all our participants towards the end of the program.</p>

    <h3>Your logo on slides at presentations about RGSoC</h3>

    <p>Students are strongly encouraged to give full talks or lightning talks at conferences, as well as local programming and tech meetups. We encourage students to present their projects and explain how Rails Girls Summer of Code is helping them do it.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, some of our organisers may also hold presentations about the program as a whole.</p>

    <p>All people presenting on behalf of or in conjunction with RGSoC are asked to include a slide with all Trailblazer sponsors’ logos at the beginning of their presentation.</p>
