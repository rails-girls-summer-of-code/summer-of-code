<h1 id="guidelines">Sponsorship Guidelines</h1>


Rails Girls Summer of Code is – above all – about people. That’s what we stand by, and it is why we source the scholarship funding from individuals as well as companies.

We are looking for sponsors that can identify with the values of Rails Girls Summer of Code and stand behind our mission to support women in technology and furthermore getting more women into Open Source. We stand for enabling women to join the community, helping to make them visible, speaking up and creating a safe space for them to learn.

The image and track record of the sponsoring companies should not conflict with our values. We can’t know all the facts about a company, but we trust them to be examples of ethical practices, and expect their track record to speak for themselves.

If there are conflicts with our values, we will discuss them on a case by case basis and take action where necessary. We review along the following principles:

+ Does the company reflect the values of Rails Girls and Rails Girls Summer of Code?
+ Do they have a strong track record in supporting women in technology?
+ Do they have a good track record in the community, as a fair employer?
+ Do they have a background of supporting Rails Girls events and/or groups before, during or after workshops?
+ Does the company show a sincere and sustainable effort in handling and overcoming a situation which conflicts with our values?

This can also mean rejecting a company as a sponsor, as we have done before and might do in the future.

## Information on VAT and Tax Deductability


### For sponsors based in Germany:
When filling out the donation form, we will show you a field to ask if VAT is a recoverable tax for you. If you answer 'yes', we will add the 19% VAT to your contribution.


### For sponsors based in other European Union country:
If you enter an EU country into the 'Country' field of the donation form, you will be shown a field for your VAT ID number. If you have one please enter it - otherwise your contribution will be reduced by 19% VAT.
e.g. If you donate $2500, and do NOT enter your VAT number, Rails Girls Summer of Code receives $2025 of your donation.


### For sponsors based elsewhere:
We don’t really know about tax laws everywhere in the world but according to our tax advisor: “Contributions and payments to Rails Girls Summer of Code are not deductible as charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes. However, they may be deductible under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (for US) or your local tax authority’s advice.”

## Cancellation Policy

If for some unforeseen reason the Rails Girls Summer of Code can’t go ahead as planned, sponsors will be offered a refund of their donation. Alternatively you can decide to have your donation go to the Rails Girls organization to share your donation with other, future Rails Girls events across the globe.

## Left-over monies

<!-- Calculate the relevant year -->
{% assign season_month = (site.time | date: "%m" | round ) %}
{% assign season = (site.time | date: "%Y") %}
{% if season_month > 5 %}
  {% assign season = (season | plus: "1") %}
{% endif %}

Any money left over from the campaign will be saved for next year’s Rails Girls Summer of Code. Should there be no Summer of Code in {{ season }}, the Rails Girls organization will decide how to best spend any left over donation money on other non-profit initiatives.
