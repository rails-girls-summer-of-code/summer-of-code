    Rails Girls Summer of Code is a program open to people around the world which provides full-time scholarships for three months over the summer. In the last three years, <strong>104 students</strong> from <strong>23 countries</strong> worked on a total of <strong>39 Open Source projects</strong> through our initiative. RGSoC helps women develop their programming skills by getting them involved in open-source projects and, at the same time, makes Tech a better place for everyone. <strong>It is not just about coding, it is changing the world while we code.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>

    This year, we wanted to acknowledge all the support</a> we have received to this program and co-create something that represents our joint effort to make the Tech Community more inclusive. The <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-04-22-thank-you-lets-diversify-tech">thank_you board</a> (on the video above) portrays a community that evolves because of the actions of each individual, becoming more inclusive.

  </p>
  <p>

    Each square added means that someone or a group of people has jumpstarted their career in tech and on the back of those squares, there is the name of a person or company who contributed to RGSoC. <strong>With your support we have already added 445 squares to our board and funded 11 teams.<strong> This is amazing! 
  </p>

  <p>
    </strong>Let’s complete this board and fund even more teams! Let’s #DiversifyTech!</strong>
