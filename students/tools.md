## Tools

In the process of organizing this year's Summer of Code, we also review the
tools and services used last year to keep track of the team's activities, keep
in touch with each other, support channels, etc. We will provide you with all
the details well in advance.

As a first step, you can already get aquainted with Github.

<!-- For Rails Girls Summer of Code we are going to use the following tools.

We've picked IRC, GitHub and GoogleGroups, tools which are
used very widely in the Ruby community, because:

* You'll learn to use the tools that the community uses, so
  you'll be in a great position to carry on after the program.

* It will be easy for you to connect with others. Your coaches and mentors will be familiar
  with these tools so it will be easy for them to give support.

Please be sure to make yourself familiar with these tools. Don't hesitate
to play with IRC and GitHub issues and try everything out.


### Daily team log updates: Getting an overview

We'd like you to keep a log of short, daily status updates for your team, in a
blog (from which we would need the URL). This can be any blog tool you like,
but it should have an RSS or Atom feed. We will use this feed to aggregate all
students' updates in a central place.

Please be sure you have a simple blog set up where you can post a short
summary and status update daily.


### IRC for quick questions, remote support and fun

We will use an IRC channel for remote support, quick questions that you have
and just hanging out and having fun. We'd like you, your coaches and maybe
project maintainers to join this channel: `#rgsoc-teams` on `irc.freenode.net`.
Also feel free to join our organizers channel at `#rgsoc` on the same host.

Here is a short explanation from Ellen about
[how to use IRC](https://github.com/RailsGirlsBerlin/summer-of-code/wiki/IRC).

Please note: In order to get the attention of a coach start your message to
the IRC channel by writing `coaches:` (including the colon). Get the attention
of an organizer by writing at `organizers:`.

Coaches and organizers will have highlight words set up for these terms, so
their IRC client will notify them with an alert. If you don't use these
highlight words they might miss your questions for quite a while because
they might be looking at another channel or even have the IRC client window
in the background. -->


### GitHub for to-dos and project specific discussions

[GitHub](http://github.com) is probably the most used common tool for
developers today. It is not only fantastic for sharing code. GitHub issues also
make one of the nicest places to discuss things (not only code!).

We recommend you use GitHub Issues as much as possible for keeping track of
to-dos and having general discussions about your project. If you are a new to
GitHub, checkout some of their tutorials e.g. [on
youtube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7RrmoueENv9TZts3HXXtw).


### Community mailing list for general questions

We will continue to use our
[community mailing-list](http://groups.google.com/group/rails-girls-summer-of-code-community)
to reach everyone involved at Rails Girls Summer of Code.

We recommend you post to this list for meta discussions and general questions
about Rails Girls Summer of Code.


### Email us for personal questions

If there should be anything you would not want to discuss publicly then send us
an email to [summer-of-code@railsgirls.com](mailto:summer-of-code@railsgirls.com).

This email address forwards to our internal organizers mailinglist and only
organizers have access to it.
