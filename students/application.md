<h3 id="eligibility">Who is eligible to apply?</h3>

**All people with non-binary gender identities or who identify as women (transgender or cisgender) are welcome to apply**. Aside from this main requirement, we look for applicants

* who **are involved with or have attended one or more workshops** organized by communities like <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>, <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a>, <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a>, <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a>, or similar initiatives.

* with **at least one year’s experience of continuous learning**, i.e. people who have significantly expanded their programming skills in a study group or independently by working on a suitable project. We will ask for coding examples.

* who can **spend 3 months (July to September) working full-time<a href="#part-time-teams">\*</a>** on their Open Source project of choice.

* who are **proficient (spoken and written) in English**. You will be communicating with several people from different countries, writing daily logs and blog posts, and English is our main language of communication.

* who **have never participated in our program before**.

You do not have to be a student at a University to apply, and there are certainly no degree or age limitations.  

<h3 id="stipend">How much is the scholarship?</h3>

The scholarship will be dependent on where you live, how much your expenses are, and any special circumstances which you might wish to share with us so that we can consider them.

<h3 id="components">What do you need to apply?</h3>

<h4 id="pair">Another student to pair with</h4>

**Finding a teammate before submitting your application is required**. Each team consists of two people, working from the same city.  

Having a team that consists of more than two students is not possible. It is also not possible to apply alone.  

It’s important that you both work well together as you will be working very closely throughout the program, planning your team goals together, and being the first point of support for one another!  

If you don’t know **how to go about finding a teammate**, check out our detailed guide <a href="/students/finding-your-team">here</a>.


<h4 id="coaches">Coaches</h4>

Coaches are developers who help you with your project. They sit down with you at regular intervals, guide you through relevant coding steps and troubleshoot problems you may run into. Consequently, it’s recommended that coaches are based in the same city as the team.  

Based on past experiences, **we recommend 4–8 hours per week of coaching time**. Therefore, we require a minimum of 2 coaches per team, and a maximum of 4, so they can share the time commitment. This way, you and your teammate will have more support coverage without exhausting just one coach.
 

Our **<a href="/guide/coaching/">guide for coaches</a>** will give you insight on what’s required of them and help you explain what is needed to prospective coaches. For further information on how to find coaches, we have also prepared a detailed guide <a href="/students/finding-your-team">here</a>.


<h4 id="workplace">A place to work</h4>

Working at a desk right next to your teammate and your coaches is the ideal scenario. You will need **a work environment beneficial to dedicating yourself to your project for 3 months**. This could be your home, a co-working space, your current work office or a <a href="/guide/coaching-company/">Coaching Company</a>. As long as you are safe and productive, you can freely choose from where you will work.


<h4 id="self-mgmt">The ability to self-manage and motivate</h4>

This is a very important point for us, as the program is self-guided. There won’t be anyone next to you at all times, telling you what to do. While you will have time with your coaches each week, you won’t have them by your side 24/7.  

As a team, you will be required to **define your goals for the program and plan together how you will meet these goals**. We are always here to help you with the planning, but it’s up to you to stick to your plan and achieve your goals. 

<h4 id="project">A project</h4>

Your project must be selected from <a href="https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects">our list of projects approved for RGSoC 2018</a>. We have a wonderful variety of interesting Open Source projects, so we understand that it can be tricky to know how to choose!

Ask your prospective coaches for their input on which project they feel would be suitable, and talk to other people in your local community — in particular, people who are familiar with your level of experience. We also recommend **getting in touch with the mentor of the project you are considering applying for** to introduce yourself, talk about the project features you'd like to work on, and see whether they think you’d be a good fit.  


<h3 id="place-application">Submitting your application</h3>

At the bottom of this guide, you will find a checklist to help you make sure that you have everything you need for a complete application.  


Before filling out the application form, **you will need to create a team**. Click on “New Team” on the <a href="https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams">Teams page</a> and add all your team members (teammate and coaches). After saving your team, clicking “Apply now” in the navigation should take you to the application form.

**The application form itself is split into three sections**. In the first section, you will be asked to answer questions about yourself, your experience with coding so far, and other information that is relevant to our decision-making process. We want to get to know you! You and your teammate will fill in this information separately.

The other sections are related to your project and team setup and they should be filled out as a team. In the project section, select your project via the drop-down menu. You will also have the opportunity to **select a secondary project as a backup**, in case you don’t get your first choice. Adding a second project to your application is not mandatory.

It is possible to save drafts of your application. This means that you can partially fill it in, and save your progress for later. **Once your application is submitted, it won’t be possible to edit or delete it**, so only submit the application once everything has been filled out properly.

Due to some application glitches last year, which might or might not have been the result of simultaneous editing, we’d recommend team members not to fill out the application form at the same time, as this can result in loss of data.

If you have any queries about the application process, please <a href="mailto:contact@rgsoc.org">contact us</a>.

<h3 id="selection">Selection process</h3>

**Applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis** by a group of real human beings in the coding community; we aim for a diverse group of teams consisting of different countries, projects, backgrounds and skill levels.

Remember: Successful applications are not “first in, best dressed”, but are judged on how well they fulfill eligibility criteria.

On top of the <a href="#eligibility">eligibity criteria</a> above, there are a few other things we pay attention to during the selection process and which can impact the final rating of your application.

* **Community involvement is important**. The more involved you are, the better.
* Experience: We want you to have some experience in programming and working in a team. We don’t expect you to be an expert, but **knowledge of some basic concepts and practices** is an advantage.
* **Concise code examples**: The best case scenario is linking to a completed coding challenge provided by your mentor (if provided). Links to good and somewhat brief examples of code written by you are a good option, too.
* Don’t hesitate to share your prior accomplishments. Have you ever built something cool? Do you have **achievements you are proud of**? Or just small but functioning things you made for fun? Your ability to set goals and be proud of your achievements is what matters.
* We don’t require you having local coaches, but **strong local support** is a factor that makes your team stronger and your participation in the program more productive. However, we understand that not all locations make it easy to find local coaches and we consider this circumstance too.
* The **project of your choice might also impact our selection** decisions. We don’t often choose more than one team per project; so the higher the competition for the project of your choice is, the harder it may be to go through the selection process. You can see how many teams applied to which projects <a href="https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/">here</a>.

**Don’t rush your application**, but rather take your time to find your teammate, your coaches, and choose the most suitable project for your team.

Applications sent after the deadline cannot be considered for selection.

<h3 id="requirements-program">Requirements during the program</h3>

Rails Girls Summer of Code focuses on students learning to code, but it’s also a community event. Throughout the program, we have the following **requirements which students have to sign for in a written agreement** prior to starting the program.

You will agree to:

* Participate full-time from July 1st to September 30th
* Continuously work on your chosen and approved Open Source project
* Keep track of your work with a short, daily summary
* Keep in regular contact with your supervisor and your mentor and stick to previously agreed upon reaction times for answering communication
* Provide an email address for communication about social and promotional events
* Participate in non-coding related community events (e.g. the all-team chat, RGSoC social events)
* Agree to have team information published on our website and blog (e.g. team introduction, team blog posts); this includes a photo or other likeness of yourself
* In case of participation in a conference where tickets are provided by RGSoC, hold a lightning talk about your project work or write a blog post about the conference


Rails Girls Summer of Code will assist and support you with any of these requirements. **For further insight on this or on setting up a good working environment, please read our article on <a href="/students/todo/">“What to expect”</a>** where we have collected suggestions and recommendations for our students.

We strongly advise you to get acquainted with these requirements before and during application time. We will make sure they are complied with and will take steps in case of breaches.

If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:contact@rgsoc.org">contact us</a>.

<h3 id="part-time-teams">A note on part-time teams</h3>

This year, **Rails Girls Summer of Code has introduced part-time teams** in addition to the full-time teams. Part-time teams are teams that participate in the program part-time (~20 hours a week) with the monthly stipend.

Part-time teams adhere to the same guidelines as full-time teams, receive the same amount of support as the other teams and are just as involved in the social activities. Due to this, part-time teams are also subjected to the selection process.

In your application, you will have the option to select whether you are applying as a full-time team, a part-time team, or you can select both options.  

<h3 id="checklist">Before you apply: the checklist</h3>
