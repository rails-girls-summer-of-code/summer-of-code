            <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code will pay the selected students 1500 USD per month for a three months period, so they can dedicate themselves to their Open Source projects full-time. As a sponsor, you will be crucial to make that happen.</p>
            <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is all about the community. You will support it as a global project, so your sponsorship will enter a budget pool from which the selected students will be paid.</p>
            <p>If you are willing to support us, here is what we offer:</p>
            <ul class="donation-plans" id="sponsoring">
              <li><strong>Bronze - 5,000 USD</strong>
                <p>
                  Your logo on our website, lots of tweet love from the community.
                </p>

                <a href="#" class="donate-button button" data-amount="500000" data-name="Bronze">Become a Sponsor!</a>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Silver - 10,000 USD</strong>
                <p>
                  Same as bronze, but with a bigger logo on the website and a quote or testimonial from your company in the press kit.

            <p>Logos on the website will be sorted by amount and date. Please read the information on VAT and tax deductibility in the FAQ if you are contributing from within the EU and especially from Germany.</p>
            <p>It is also possible to sponsor a lower amount, we will be happy about it as well. Should you wish, we could put your name in the thank you list.</p>
            <p>Doesn't this sound awesome? Please, drop us a line at <a href="mailto: summer-of-code@railsgirls.com" title="mail to the sponsor-team">summer-of-code@railsgirls.com</a> and mention the magic code "Sponsor" in the subject line. We will get back to you shortly with more details.</p>
            <p>We are also currently working on additional ideas that haven't been finalized yet, such as cross-promotions with podcasters, newsletters and blogs. More info coming soon.</p>
            <p>If you happen to have other ideas or if you're missing something on this list, please get in touch!</p>
            <p>We are looking forward to having you on board as a sponsor!</p>
