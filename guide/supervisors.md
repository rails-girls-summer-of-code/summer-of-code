<h1>Becoming a Rails Girls Summer of Code Supervisor</h1>

Each year we are also looking for caring people to supervise 1–2 teams throughout the Summer of Code. Supervisors act as a bridge between the Rails Girls Summer of Code orga team and the individual project teams made up of students, coaches, and mentors.

Supervisors check in with their teams regularly to see if everything is going smoothly and if there’s anything the team needs help with. The role of Supervisor is non-technical, so you do not have to be a coder to become a supervisor.

If you are thinking of supporting Rails Girls Summer of Code as a Supervisor, the following guidelines should help you make up your mind if this is a good fit for you.

<h3 id="what-it-takes">What it takes to be a good supervisor</h3>

One of the most important things a supervisor does is provide moral support to the students. That's why a good supervisor should be friendly, open, and well-organized.

<h3 id="what">What does a supervisor do?</h3>

A supervisor acts as the “glue” between the Rails Girls Summer of Code organizational team and the individual teams (students, coaches, and project mentors) they are assigned to. Their job is to regularly communicate with coaches and students and make sure all things are running smoothly.

We suggest arranging for a short video call once a week to touch base and discuss anything that might arise. Supervisors should also continuously check on the students and their progress. This includes checking the daily log and making sure that things are going forward as planned. The job also entails lending an ear to students in frustrating moments and just generally being a pillar of support for the teams.

The supervisor will be the team’s contact person for all organizational aspects and should also make sure that all non-coding to-dos required by Summer of Code — such as blog posts for the RGSoC blog or participation in the conference raffle — are done.  
Don’t worry! We’ll give you a checklist and deadlines, and we will nudge you gently if you forget about some of them.

<h3 id="code">But I can't code! Can I be a supervisor anyway?</h3>

Of course! Supervisors aren’t required to have technical skills or answer code-related questions — that’s what the coaches and our help desk are for. It is useful if you have a bit of knowledge when it comes to some of the tools we use, like GitHub, as you might have to check on commits or pull requests.

<h3 id="time">How much time does being a supervisor take?</h3>

Being a supervisor means committing to support your teams for the whole 3 months of Rails Girls Summer of Code (July–September). On average, you should be able to put aside half an hour a day for 3 to 5 days a week.

<h3 id="apply">How can I apply?</h3>

The best way to apply is to just drop us a line at <a href="mailto:contact@rgsoc.org">contact@rgsoc.org</a> telling us you want to help out. We can’t wait to hear from you!
