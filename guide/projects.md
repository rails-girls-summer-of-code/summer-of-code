<h1>Becoming a Project Mentor</h1>

You wish to support women working full-time on Open Source projects for three months, want to help newcomers get into Open Source and plan to submit your project?

Here is some general information about your role as a mentor, as well as guidelines for the submission; RGSoC is a remote and distributed program, so you can get involved from anywhere, as long as you have access to the internet. We welcome project submissions in any programming language!

<strong><em>Note: Submissions are now closed.</em></strong>

<h3 id="q1">What is a good project?</h3>

A good Open Source project to propose for RGSoC 2016:


* has an open-source license
* is established enough to allow collaboration (beyond the set-up phase)
* has a dedicated contact person/maintainer
* is beginner/junior-friendly (open to newcomers, maintains an inviting, helpful and understanding communication and a non-discriminating environment, etc.)
* can abide by the rules of our [Code of Conduct](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/code-of-conduct/)

Having a Code of Conduct or similar guidelines on your project is encouraged. Projects have to provide a mentor who will act as an expert in the project's domain; however, in their day-to-day work students will be supported by coaches, so the workload for project mentor is limited.

<h3 id="q2">What is a good mentor? What does it entail?</h3>

Mentors are patient, tolerant and open people! Ideally you are already familiar with the [Rails Girls](http://www.railsgirls.com) movement or other newcomer initiatives. You care about diversity and making Open Source projects more accessible to newcomers.
A mentor is a maintainer of the proposed project (or a core-contributor) and is the dedicated contact person for the team over the summer.

Being a mentor entails:

* providing guidance and feedback concerning your project through the summer
* helping the students to apply: suggesting and discussing issues or features to work on
* being in contact with the whole student team throughout the summer
* following the rules of our [Code of Conduct](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/code-of-conduct/)



<h3 id="q3">How much time does being a project mentor take?</h3>

Every team and project are different; to have a successful summer sometimes means putting in more or less hours of work. But in general you can expect this:

* Time at the beginning of the summer to help the team get set up (especially for more challenging projects)
* Time for you to to get acquainted with the program, the organisers and the core team (onboarding)
* Email and chat availability July 1st to September 30th
* 1-3h/week over the course of the program for answering questions and emails, including some time twice a month for  ~1h calls



<h3 id="q4">Why should I submit my project?</h3>

By submitting your project for Rails Girls Summer of Code, you are allowing your project to be part of a worldwide movement that encourages more diversity in Open Source.  Furthermore you get:

* diverse feedback (eg. suggestions on important/missing features, documentation improvements, a fresh outlook on your project)
* the possibility to tackle time-consuming issues (eg. implementation of new features)
* more visibility within the community
* new contributors who might want to stick around after the summer!
* all in all: the chance to develop a sustainable Open Source project


<h3 id="q5">How do I submit my project?</h3>

<em>Note: Submissions are now closed for 2016. See you next year!</em>
<br>You can submit your project on our [Teams App](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org); you will need to authenticate with GitHub. Once logged in:

* click on “Submit your project” in the navigation bar
* By default, we assume the submitter is also the primary mentor. If that isn’t the case, enter the name of the primary Mentor as well as their email address and GitHub handle.
* Add a title and a description: what the project is about, what stage it’s at, and maybe something about the team behind it
* Add Issues and features: outline features you’re planning for the future—or just make a list of issues that need work
* Add keywords: this can mean a language, like Ruby, but also specific technologies or concepts needed.
* You can flag your project as “suitable for beginners” by using the available checkbox
* Click Submit!

On the “All Projects” page, you can view all submitted projects and their status (proposed, accepted, rejected) as well as edit or delete your submission.


<h3 id="q6">I'd like to submit my project, but what if I have no time to be a mentor?</h3>

We want to make this clear: for a project to be considered for the program, the students must have someone they can rely on to answer their project-specific questions. As such, we feel that a core contributor of the project fits this role of "project mentor" best.

However we understand that the maintainers of some established projects have busy schedules; which is why we encourage you to ask the community for help! If there are other regular and motivated contributors to your project who you think fit the profile of a good mentor and whom you trust to be experts on the subject, please ask them if they would be interested in being project mentors. If that doesn't work, get in touch with us directly – maybe we can find a solution together.
