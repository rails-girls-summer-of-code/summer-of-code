<h1>Becoming a Project Mentor</h1>
  

Note: <strong>There will be no RGSoC this year</strong> as we <a href="../blog/2019-03-21-the-future-of-rgsoc">focus on our rebranding</a> and a restructuring of the program. Even though we will not organise a 2019 edition, we're still committed to connecting contributors from underrepresented groups who want to work on open source through our network and social media. If you're interested in supporting new contributors and getting your project added to our <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/code-with-these-oss-projects/">project list</a>, please <a href="mailto:contact@rgsoc.org">send us an email</a>.

<h3 id="q1">What is a good project?</h3>

A good Open Source project to propose for RGSoC:


* has at least one [open-source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) (dual, OS/commercial licenses are usually ok but will be looked at on a case-by-case basis),
* is established enough to allow collaboration (beyond the set-up phase),
* has a dedicated contact person/maintainer,
* is beginner/junior-friendly (open to newcomers; maintains an inviting, helpful and understanding communication and a non-discriminating environment; etc.),
* can abide by the rules of our [Code of Conduct](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/code-of-conduct/),
* has a Code of Conduct or similar guidelines,
* has to provide a mentor who will act as an expert in the project’s domain.


<h3 id="q2">What does a good mentor do?</h3>

A mentor is a maintainer of the proposed project (or a core-contributor) and is the dedicated contact person for our community's contributors.  

Mentors are patient, tolerant and open people. You care about diversity and making Open Source projects more accessible to newcomers. Ideally, you are already familiar with the [Rails Girls](http://www.railsgirls.com) movement or other newcomer initiatives.

Being a mentor entails:

* Providing guidance and feedback concerning your project  
* Helping contributors by suggesting and discussing issues or features for them to work on  
* following the rules of our [Code of Conduct](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/code-of-conduct/)

<h3 id="q4">Why should I submit my project?</h3>

By submitting your project for Rails Girls Summer of Code you are allowing your project to become part of a worldwide movement that encourages more diversity in Open Source.  
Furthermore, you will get:

* Diverse feedback, e.g. suggestions on important/missing features, documentation improvements, a fresh outlook on your project
* The possibility to tackle time-consuming issues that you usually don’t get around to, e.g. implementation of new features
* More visibility within the community
* New contributors who might want to stick around after the program
* All in all: the chance to develop a sustainable Open Source project


<h3 id="q5">How do I submit my project?</h3>

The deadline to submit projects has passed and a comprehensive list of projects for contributors has already been published <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/code-with-these-oss-projects/">on our blog</a>.
