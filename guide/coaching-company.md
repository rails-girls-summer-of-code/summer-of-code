Some select companies who have been Coaching Companies in the past are Absolventa, Travis CI, SoundCloud, NIRD, GitHub, 6Wunderkinder.


Note: <strong>There will be no RGSoC this year</strong> as we <a href="../blog/2019-03-21-the-future-of-rgsoc">focus on our rebranding</a> and a restructuring of the program. Even though we will not organise a 2019 edition, we're still committed to connecting contributors from underrepresented groups who want to work on open source through our network and social media. If you're interested in supporting a team of volunteers in your local community, send an email to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rails-girls-summer-of-code-community">community mailing list</a> stating that you are offering your space and coaches and saying where you are located. You can also spread the word by mentioning us on Twitter (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC">@RailsGirlsSoC</a>); we’ll retweet and help you connect with prospective contributors. Don't hesitate to reach out to us <a href="mailto:contact@rgsoc.org">by email</a> if you have any questions!

<h3 id="q3">What does a Coaching Company do?</h3>

A coaching company provides a home for a team including:  

<ul>
  <li>a dedicated space in an office,</li>
  <li>available coaches for questions and support,</li>
  <li>an inclusive culture and safe space.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="q5">Where are Coaching Companies located?</h3>

The Rails Girls Summer of Code community is international, and our participants work on their projects all over the world. Consequently, Coaching Companies can be located anywhere in the world as well.  

In fact, we explicitly encourage companies from all over the world to get involved; wherever you are located, there is probably a team that could really use your support.
