So what is Rails Girls Summer of Code all about?

Rails Girls Summer of Code is a global fellowship program aimed at bringing
more diversity into Open Source. Successful applicants are paid a monthly
stipend, from July-September, to work on Open Source projects of their choice.

Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping newcomers to the world of
programming further expand their knowledge and skills, by contributing to a
worthwhile Open Source project. The focus is not on producing highly
sophisticated code, but rather participants learning transferable skills
from their project work.

Rails Girls Summer of Code is a not-for-profit organization that operates
solely on the generous donations of sponsors, and individuals from the
community.

## Help make Open Source a better place for everyone.

We want to provide a safe space for everyone involved. Please read our
[Code of Conduct](/about/code-of-conduct).
