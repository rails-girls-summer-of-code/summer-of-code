      <h3>About Rails Girls Summer of Code</h3>
      <p>
      Rails Girls Summer of Code is a scholarship that funds women around the world to work full-time over the summer on open-source software projects. Modelled after Google Summer of Code, but with a focus on beginners and women wanting to go into programming full-time, Rails Girls Summer of Code aims to get women involved in open-source and is the first ever event of its kind in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
      Since 2013, over 580 women all over the world have applied and up to this date, RGSoC has supported 146 students — with a total of 51 sponsored teams and 24 volunteering teams. Recently, a survey conducted by RGSoC revealed that 90% of the students are still working in tech and 8% have founded their startups. 55% of those students still regularly contribute to Open Source projects.

      <p>
      In 2016, over 90 teams applied for the program, almost doubling RGSoC 2015’s record! So far, 44 Open Source projects were accepted for this edition and 20 teams were selected. All selected teams, including volunteer teams, <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-07-01-RGSoC-2016-day-one">were announced</a> at the beginning of June. Meanwhile, RGSoC has launched the <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-04-22-thank-you-lets-diversify-tech">#diversifytech</a> campaign to thank all of the people who have contributed to the program.
      </p>

      <p>
      Since its inception, RGSoC has been supported by companies like Travis CI, GitHub, Google, GitLab, Envato, Basecamp and SoundCloud, to name a few. At the same time, thousands of people have backed this initiative individually. <br>
      RGSoC students have contributed to overall 39 Open Source projects, like Bundler, Rails, Discourse, Sinatra, Diaspora, impress.js, Hackety Hack, Hoodie, Speakerinnen, Lotus (now Hanami) and Conductor.
