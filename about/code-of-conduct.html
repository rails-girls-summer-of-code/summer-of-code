<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>A primary goal of Rails Girls Summer of Code is to be inclusive to all of
our part-takers — participants, coaches, mentors, supervisors and everyone in
the organizing team, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As
such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment
for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>We invite all those who participate in Rails Girls Summer of Code to help us
create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="welcoming">Welcoming environment</h2>
<p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase an open and
welcoming environment by encouraging community participants to recognize and
strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our
community.</p>
<p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is
essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that
exist in society.</p>

<h2 id="expected">Expected Behavior</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Participate in a supporting and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.</li>
	<li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li>
	<li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
	<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
	<li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert the <a href="#contact">trust committee</a> if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unacceptable">Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
<p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in
our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications
carried out in the context of team work. Community event venues may be shared
with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these
locations.</p>
<p>Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related
to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of
nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides);
deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or
recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>


<h3 id="consequences">Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a
temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.</p>

<strong>If unacceptable behavior is reported, the Rails Girls Summer of Code team will take action and send out a first and last warning to the person who showed unacceptable behaviour. If any other breaches of our Code of Conduct are reported, the person will be removed from the program immediately, without any other warning necessary.</strong>

<h3 id="witness">If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify a member of the trust committee as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, members of the trust committee are available to help community
members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person
events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person
experiencing distress.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise;
sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community
venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications during
all things and activities related to Rails Girls Summer of Code.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact and Trust Committee</h2>
<p>We have set up a trust committee that consist of both people involved with
organizing, and externals. You can contact the person you feel most comfortable
reaching out to. By offering external contacts that are not involved in the
project we want to make sure that if you have problems with people involved in
the organization, you have a safe contact to turn to. They will act as a
mediator. The trust committee will leave your request anonymous (unless this is
not an issue for you) and devote their time to fixing any issue you might have.
This covers everything from feeling uncomfortable with somebody, having
personal issues in your life you need help with, feeling bullied,
misunderstood, discriminated against, disrespected, etc..</p>
