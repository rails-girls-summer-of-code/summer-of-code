<h1>Join our team</h1>

<p>Organizers eat, sleep and breathe RGSoC. This is the small group of people who make sure the program runs smoothly. They have an intimate knowledge of how the program works and dedicate the hours to making it happen.</p>

<p>Here are just some of the things organizers take care of to make sure our teams are informed, involved and cared for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Updating and maintaining the website and <a href="https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">Teams App</a></li>
    <li>Writing and editing newsletter, blog and social media posts</li>
    <li>Creating eye-catching visuals</li>
    <li>Regularly communicating with mentors and students</li>
    <li>Finding and inducting supervisors and the Trust Committee members</li>
    <li>Assessing, selecting and supporting suitable applications</li>
    <li>Reaching out to sponsors and handling finances</li>
    <li>Issuing fair stipends to teams in all areas of the globe</li>
    <li>Collecting and distributing sponsors swag</li>
