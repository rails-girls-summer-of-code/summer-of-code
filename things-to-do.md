## Things To Do

Here is a list of things that we would like you to do during the program:

* Post brief status [updates on your team log](/team-log) daily.

* Write up at least one, maybe two blog posts for the Rails Girls Summer of
  Code blog throughout the program. You can write whatever post you like, include
  creative ideas, ... as long as it's related to your amazing work on your
  project :)

* Visit your local developers user groups, hackdays, community events, etc. so
  you get to connect with your local community.

* Give at least one lightning talk at a conference, local user group, Rails
  Girls (or similar) workshop.

* Focus on your work.

* Use all the support channels and ask all the questions that you have!

* Have fun :)

If you are working with a pair (and most of you do) then all of these things
refer to you as a pair, too.  I.e. you don't have to post individual status
updates to your log. You can give a lightning talk together with your pair, and
it's probably more fun to visit a user group together.



### Visit community events and conferences

Obviously you should spend the precious work time that you have focussing on your
work. But we'd also like you to get in touch with the community vis-a-vis, if
possible, so you get a feeling for that vibe, too.

Maybe you schedule visiting evening events like local Ruby user group meetings
once a month, and then visit a conference that is close to your place soon
after the program.

We recommend to plan for giving at least a brief lightning talk at any such event,
too, so you get to share the love and practice speaking in front of bunch of
people :)

Don't feel too scared about presenting your work and experience at such events!
Of course everyone is (seriously, even experienced, seasoned speakers are).

But on the other hand everyone in the community also loves what you are doing
(you can see how this program is being received by looking at the success of
our campaign). And people will love it, hold you in high respect and give their
support if you pluck up your courage to tell them about your experience (even
if just briefly).

If you find a conference that you'd like to visit, then please tell us! We
might know the organizers (or people who know them) and maybe we can sort out
free tickets etc. for you.
